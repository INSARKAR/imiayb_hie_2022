TI  - Usage and effect of health information exchange: a systematic review.
PG  - 803-11
LID - 10.7326/M14-0877 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE) is increasing in the United States,
      and it is incentivized by government policies. PURPOSE: To systematically review 
      and evaluate evidence of the use and effect of HIE on clinical care. DATA
      SOURCES: Selected databases from 1 January 2003 to 31 May 2014. STUDY SELECTION: 
      English-language hypothesis-testing or quantitative studies of several types of
      data exchange among unaffiliated organizations for use in clinical care that
      addressed health outcomes, efficiency, utilization, costs, satisfaction, HIE
      usage, sustainability, and attitudes or barriers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data
      extraction was done in duplicate. DATA SYNTHESIS: Low-quality evidence from 12
      hypothesis-testing studies supports an effect of HIE use on reduced use or costs 
      in the emergency department. Direct evidence that HIEs were used by providers was
      reported in 21 studies involving 13 distinct HIE organizations, 6 of which were
      located in New York, and generally showed usage in less than 10% of patient
      encounters. Findings from 17 studies of sustainability suggest that approximately
      one quarter of existing HIE organizations consider themselves financially stable.
      Findings from 38 studies about attitudes and barriers showed that providers,
      patients, and other stakeholders consider HIE to be valuable, but barriers
      include technical and workflow issues, costs, and privacy concerns. LIMITATION:
      Publication bias, possible selective reporting of outcomes, and a dearth of
      reporting on context and implementation processes. CONCLUSION: Health information
      exchange use probably reduces emergency department usage and costs in some cases.
      Effects on other outcomes are unknown. All stakeholders claim to value HIE, but
      many barriers to acceptance and sustainability exist. A small portion of
      operational HIEs have been evaluated, and more research is needed to identify and
      understand success factors. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department of Veterans
      Affairs. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014007469).

TI  - The benefits of health information exchange: an updated systematic review.
PG  - 1259-1265
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy035 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Widespread health information exchange (HIE) is a national objective
      motivated by the promise of improved care and a reduction in costs. Previous
      reviews have found little rigorous evidence that HIE positively affects these
      anticipated benefits. However, early studies of HIE were methodologically
      limited. The purpose of the current study is to review the recent literature on
      the impact of HIE. Methods: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct our systematic review. PubMed and
      Scopus databases were used to identify empirical articles that evaluated HIE in
      the context of a health care outcome. Results: Our search strategy identified 24 
      articles that included 63 individual analyses. The majority of the studies were
      from the United States representing 9 states; and about 40% of the included
      analyses occurred in a handful of HIEs from the state of New York. Seven of the
      24 studies used designs suitable for causal inference and all reported some
      beneficial effect from HIE; none reported adverse effects. Conclusions: The
      current systematic review found that studies with more rigorous designs all
      reported benefits from HIE. Such benefits include fewer duplicated procedures,
      reduced imaging, lower costs, and improved patient safety. We also found that
      studies evaluating community HIEs were more likely to find benefits than studies 
      that evaluated enterprise HIEs or vendor-mediated exchanges. Overall, these
      finding bode well for the HIEs ability to deliver on anticipated improvements in 
      care delivery and reduction in costs.

TI  - The organizational and clinical impact of integrating bedside equipment to an
      information system: a systematic literature review of patient data management
      systems (PDMS).

LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.12.002 [doi]
LID - S1386-5056(14)00247-0 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The introduction of an information system integrated to bedside
      equipment requires significant financial and resource investment; therefore
      understanding the potential impact is beneficial for decision-makers. However, no
      systematic literature reviews (SLRs) focus on this topic. This SLR aims to gather
      evidence on the impact of the aforementioned system, also known as a patient data
      management system (PDMS) on both organizational and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using the databases Medline/PubMed
      and CINHAL for English articles published between January 2000 and December 2012.
      A quality assessment was performed on articles deemed relevant for the SLR.
      RESULTS: Eighteen articles were included in the SLR. Sixteen articles
      investigated the impact of a PDMS on the organizational outcomes, comprising
      descriptive, quantitative and qualitative studies. A PDMS was found to reduce the
      charting time, increase the time spent on direct patient care and reduce the
      occurrence of errors. Only two articles investigated the clinical impact of a
      PDMS. Both reported an improvement in clinical outcomes when a PDMS was
      integrated with a clinical decision support system (CDSS). CONCLUSIONS: A PDMS
      has shown to offer many advantages in both the efficiency and the quality of care
      delivered to the patient. In addition, a PDMS integrated to a CDSS may improve
      clinical outcomes, although further studies are required for validation.

TI  - Access control and privilege management in electronic health record: a systematic
      literature review.
PG  - 261
AB  - This study presents a systematic literature review of access control for
      electronic health record systems to protect patient's privacy. Articles from 2006
      to 2016 were extracted from the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library,
      Science Direct, MEDLINE, and MetaPress using broad eligibility criteria, and
      chosen for inclusion based on analysis of ISO22600. Cryptographic standards and
      methods were left outside the scope of this review. Three broad classes of models
      are being actively investigated and developed: access control for electronic
      health records, access control for interoperability, and access control for risk 
      analysis. Traditional role-based access control models are extended with spatial,
      temporal, probabilistic, dynamic, and semantic aspects to capture contextual
      information and provide granular access control. Maintenance of audit trails and 
      facilities for overriding normal roles to allow full access in emergency cases
      are common features. Access privilege frameworks utilizing ontology-based
      knowledge representation for defining the rules have attracted considerable
      interest, due to the higher level of abstraction that makes it possible to model 
      domain knowledge and validate access requests efficiently.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Health Information Exchange (HIE) is known as a
      technology that electronically shares all clinical and administrative data
      throughout healthcare settings. Despite this technology has a great potential in 
      the healthcare industry, there is a limited and sparse evidence of articles which
      illustrated the impact of HIE on quality of care and cost-effectiveness. This
      work presents a systematic review that evaluates the impact of HIE on quality and
      cost-effectiveness, and the rates of HIE adoption and participation in healthcare
      organizations. METHODS: We systematically searched all English papers that were
      indexed in four major databases (Science Direct, PubMed, IEEE and Web of Science)
      between 2005 and 2016. Consequently, 32 identified papers appeared in 21
      international journals and conferences. Eligible studies independently were
      critically appraised, collected within data extraction form and then thematically
      analyzed by two reviewers and if necessary, the third author. The selected papers
      have been classified based on 11 main categories including publication year,
      journal and conference names, country and study design, types of data exchanged, 
      healthcare levels, disease or disorder, participants in organizations and
      individuals, settings characteristics and HIE types, the impact of HIE on quality
      and cost-effectiveness, and the rates of HIE adoption and participation. RESULTS:
      Of the 32 articles, 25 studies investigated the financial and clinical impact of 
      HIE. Overwhelmingly, HIE studies have reported positive findings for quality and 
      cost-effectiveness of care. 15 of HIE studies (60%) demonstrated positive
      financial effects and 16 studies (64%) reported positive effects on quality
      improvement of patient care. However, the overall quality of the evidences was
      low. In this regard, cohort study (59.38%) was the most common used study design.
      Nine studies presented the rates of HIE adoption and participation. The lowest
      and highest participation rates were 15.7% and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      HIE can be considered as a superior potential for healthcare information system, 
      resulting to promote patient care quality and reduce costs related to resource
      utilization. However, further researches are needed in order to provide a better 
      understanding of this domain and accordingly attain new opportunities to increase
      users' participation and motivation for successfully adopting this technology.

TI  - Trust and Credibility in Web-Based Health Information: A Review and Agenda for
      Future Research.
PG  - e218
LID - 10.2196/jmir.7579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet sources are becoming increasingly important in seeking
      health information, such that they may have a significant effect on health care
      decisions and outcomes. Hence, given the wide range of different sources of
      Web-based health information (WHI) from different organizations and individuals, 
      it is important to understand how information seekers evaluate and select the
      sources that they use, and more specifically, how they assess their credibility
      and trustworthiness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review empirical
      studies on trust and credibility in the use of WHI. The article seeks to present 
      a profile of the research conducted on trust and credibility in WHI seeking, to
      identify the factors that impact judgments of trustworthiness and credibility,
      and to explore the role of demographic factors affecting trust formation. On this
      basis, it aimed to identify the gaps in current knowledge and to propose an
      agenda for future research. METHODS: A systematic literature review was
      conducted. Searches were conducted using a variety of combinations of the terms
      WHI, trust, credibility, and their variants in four multi-disciplinary and four
      health-oriented databases. Articles selected were published in English from 2000 
      onwards; this process generated 3827 unique records. After the application of the
      exclusion criteria, 73 were analyzed fully. RESULTS: Interest in this topic has
      persisted over the last 15 years, with articles being published in medicine,
      social science, and computer science and originating mostly from the United
      States and the United Kingdom. Documents in the final dataset fell into 3
      categories: (1) those using trust or credibility as a dependent variable, (2)
      those using trust or credibility as an independent variable, and (3) studies of
      the demographic factors that influence the role of trust or credibility in WHI
      seeking. There is a consensus that website design, clear layout, interactive
      features, and the authority of the owner have a positive effect on trust or
      credibility, whereas advertising has a negative effect. With regard to content
      features, authority of the author, ease of use, and content have a positive
      effect on trust or credibility formation. Demographic factors influencing trust
      formation are age, gender, and perceived health status. CONCLUSIONS: There is
      considerable scope for further research. This includes increased clarity of the
      interaction between the variables associated with health information seeking,
      increased consistency on the measurement of trust and credibility, a greater
      focus on specific WHI sources, and enhanced understanding of the impact of
      demographic variables on trust and credibility judgments.

AB  - The exchange and use of health information can help healthcare professionals and 
      policymakers make informed decisions on ways of improving patient and population 
      health. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have however failed to
      embrace the approaches and technologies to facilitate health information exchange
      (HIE). We sought to understand the barriers and facilitators to the
      implementation and adoption of HIE in LMICs. Two reviewers independently searched
      11 academic databases for published and on-going qualitative, quantitative and
      mixed-method studies and searched for unpublished work through the Google search 
      engine. The searches covered the period from January 1990 to July 2014 and were
      not restricted by language. Eligible studies were independently, critically
      appraised and then thematically analysed. The searches yielded 5461 citations
      after de-duplication of results. Of these, 56 articles, three conference
      abstracts and four technical reports met the inclusion criteria. The lack of
      importance given to data in decision making, corruption and insecurity, lack of
      training and poor infrastructure were considered to be major challenges to
      implementing HIE, but strong leadership and clear policy direction coupled with
      the financial support to acquire essential technology, improve the communication 
      network, and provide training for staff all helped to promote implementation. The
      body of work also highlighted how implementers of HIE needed to take into account
      local needs to ensure that stakeholders saw HIE as relevant and advantageous. HIE
      interventions implemented through leapfrog technologies such as
      telehealth/telemedicine and mHealth in Brazil, Kenya, and South Africa, provided 
      successful examples of exchanging health information in LMICs despite limited
      resources and capability. It is important that implementation of HIE is aligned
      with national priorities and local needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the availability and technical quality of
      online information related to the medical care of people with disability, despite
      the potential of this information to alter clinical interactions and treatment
      decisions. OBJECTIVES: This review examines the utility of internet search
      engines for finding information related to medical care for people with
      disability, identifies common sources of this online information, and assesses
      the presence of technical attributes which allow for its critical evaluation.
      METHODS: Exhaustive systematic searches were conducted on two popular search
      engines (Google and Yahoo) using six search phrases. Resources were coded to
      categorize presenting organization, format, and technical quality. RESULTS: Only 
      8.9% of results included information related to medical care for people with
      disability. Analyzed resources were most often from non-profit organizations
      (31.7%) in website format (60.2%). The composite technical quality score for all 
      included resources had a median and mode of three on a scale of six. CONCLUSIONS:
      Online information related to medical care for people with disability is not only
      difficult to locate, but has generally low technical quality. These findings have
      implications for health information professionals, patients, care providers, and 
      information developers.

TI  - Feasibility of 30-day hospital readmission prediction modeling based on health
      information exchange data.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unplanned 30-day hospital readmission account for roughly $17
      billion in annual Medicare spending. Many factors contribute to unplanned
      hospital readmissions and multiple models have been developed over the years to
      predict them. Most researchers have used insurance claims or administrative data 
      to train and operationalize their Readmission Risk Prediction Models (RRPMs).
      Some RRPM developers have also used electronic health records data; however,
      using health informatics exchange data has been uncommon among such predictive
      models and can be beneficial in its ability to provide real-time alerts to
      providers at the point of care. METHODS: We conducted a semi-systematic review of
      readmission predictive factors published prior to March 2013. Then, we extracted 
      and merged all significant variables listed in those articles for RRPMs. Finally,
      we matched these variables with common HL7 messages transmitted by a sample of
      health information exchange organizations (HIO). RESULTS: The semi-systematic
      review resulted in identification of 32 articles and 297 predictive variables.
      The mapping of these variables with common HL7 segments resulted in an 89.2%
      total coverage, with the DG1 (diagnosis) segment having the highest coverage of
      39.4%. The PID (patient identification) and OBX (observation results) segments
      cover 13.9% and 9.1% of the variables. Evaluating the same coverage in three
      sample HIOs showed data incompleteness. DISCUSSION: HIOs can utilize HL7 messages
      to develop unique RRPMs for their stakeholders; however, data completeness of
      exchanged messages should meet certain thresholds. If data quality standards are 
      met by stakeholders, HIOs would be able to provide real-time RRPMs that not only 
      predict intra-hospital readmissions but also inter-hospital cases. CONCLUSION: A 
      RRPM derived using HIO data exchanged through may prove to be a useful method to 
      prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. In order for the RRPM derived from HIO
      data to be effective, hospitals must actively exchange clinical information
      through the HIO and develop actionable methods that integrate into the workflow
      of providers to ensure that patients at high-risk for readmission receive the
      care they need.

PG  - 123-133
LID - 10.1177/1355819617751555 [doi]
AB  - Objectives Data sharing is well established in biological research, but evidence 
      on sharing of clinical trial or public health research study data remains
      limited, in particular studies of research participants' perspectives of data
      sharing. This study systematically reviewed international evidence of research
      participants' attitudes towards the sharing of data for secondary research use.
      Methods Systematic search of seven databases, and author-, citation- and
      bibliography-follow up to identify studies examining research participants'
      attitudes towards data sharing. Studies were thematically analysed using NVivo
      v10 to identify recurring themes. Results Nine studies were eligible for
      inclusion. Thematic analysis identified four key themes: (1) benefits of data
      sharing, including benefit to participants or immediate community, benefits to
      the public and benefits to science or research; (2) fears and harms, such as fear
      of exploitation, stigmatization or repercussions, alongside concerns about
      confidentiality and misuse of data; (3) data sharing processes, in particular the
      role of consent in the process; and (4) the relationship between participants and
      research such as trust in different types of research or organization and the
      relationship with the original research team. Conclusions The available
      literature on attitudes towards sharing data from clinical trials or public
      health interventions remains scant. This study has identified four themes
      regarding research participants' attitudes and preferences, which should be
      considered by policy makers, and explored with further research.

AB  - CONTEXT: The United States has invested substantially in technologies that enable
      health information exchange (HIE), which in turn can be deployed to reduce
      avoidable hospital readmission rates in many communities. With avoidable hospital
      readmissions as the primary focus, this study profiles successful hospital
      readmission rate reduction initiatives that integrate HIE as a strategy. We
      hypothesized that the use of HIE is associated with decreased hospital
      readmissions beyond other observed population health benefits. Results of this
      systematic review are used to describe and profile successful readmission
      reduction programs that integrate HIE as a tool. METHODS: A systematic review of 
      literature provided an understanding of the use of HIE as a strategy to reduce
      hospital readmission rates. We conducted a review of 4,862 citations written in
      English about readmission reduction strategies from January 2006 to September
      2016 in the MEDLINE-PubMed database. Of these, 106 studies reported 30-day
      readmission rates as an outcome and only 13 articles reported using HIE. RESULTS:
      Only a very small number (12%) of hospitals incorporated HIE as a primary tool
      for evidence-based readmission reduction initiatives. Information exchange
      between providers has been suggested to play a key role in reducing avoidable
      readmission rates, yet there is not currently evidence supporting current
      HIE-enabled readmission initiatives. Most successful readmission reduction
      programs demonstrate collaboration with primary care providers to augment
      transitions of care to existing care management functions without additional
      staff while using effective information exchange capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      research confirms there is very little integration of HIE into health systems
      readmissions initiatives. There is a great opportunity to achieve population
      health targets using the HIE infrastructure. Hospitals should consider partnering
      with primary care clinics to implement multifaceted transitions of care programs 
      to significantly reduce 30-day readmission rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identify shared criteria used throughout the world in the
      implementation of interoperable National Health Information Systems (NHIS) and
      provide validated scientific information on the dimensions affecting
      interoperability. METHODS: This systematic review sought to identify primary
      articles on the implementation of interoperable NHIS published in scientific
      journals in English, Portuguese, or Spanish between 1990 and 2011 through a
      search of eight databases of electronic journals in the health sciences and
      informatics: MEDLINE (PubMed), Proquest, Ovid, EBSCO, MD Consult, Virtual Health 
      Library, Metapress, and SciELO. The full texts of the articles were reviewed, and
      those that focused on technical computer aspects or on normative issues were
      excluded, as well as those that did not meet the quality criteria for systematic 
      reviews of interventions. RESULTS: Of 291 studies found and reviewed, only five
      met the inclusion criteria. These articles reported on the process of
      implementing an interoperable NHIS in Brazil, China, the United States, Turkey,
      and the Semiautonomous Region of Zanzibar, respectively. Five common basic
      criteria affecting implementation of the NHIS were identified: standards in place
      to govern the process, availability of trained human talent, financial and
      structural constraints, definition of standards, and assurance that the
      information is secure. Four dimensions affecting interoperability were defined:
      technical, semantic, legal, and organizational. CONCLUSIONS: The criteria
      identified have to be adapted to the actual situation in each country and a
      proactive approach should be used to ensure that implementation of the
      interoperable NHIS is strategic, simple, and reliable.

TI  - Key components of knowledge transfer and exchange in health services research:
      Findings from a systematic scoping review.
PG  - 313-326
LID - 10.1111/jan.13836 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To identify the key common components of knowledge transfer and exchange in
      existing models to facilitate practice developments in health services research. 
      BACKGROUND: There are over 60 models of knowledge transfer and exchange designed 
      for various areas of health care. Many of them remain untested and lack
      guidelines for scaling-up of successful implementation of research findings and
      of proven models ensuring that patients have access to optimal health care,
      guided by current research. DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted in line with
      PRISMA guidelines. Key components of knowledge transfer and exchange were
      identified using thematic analysis and frequency counts. DATA SOURCES: Six
      electronic databases were searched for papers published before January 2015
      containing four key terms/variants: knowledge, transfer, framework, health care. 
      REVIEW METHODS: Double screening, extraction and coding of the data using
      thematic analysis were employed to ensure rigour. As further validation
      stakeholders' consultation of the findings was performed to ensure accessibility.
      RESULTS: Of the 4,288 abstracts, 294 full-text articles were screened, with 79
      articles analysed. Six key components emerged: knowledge transfer and exchange
      message, Stakeholders and Process components often appeared together, while from 
      two contextual components Inner Context and the wider Social, Cultural and
      Economic Context, with the wider context less frequently considered. Finally,
      there was little consideration of the Evaluation of knowledge transfer and
      exchange activities. In addition, specific operational elements of each component
      were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The six components offer the basis for knowledge
      transfer and exchange activities, enabling researchers to more effectively share 
      their work. Further research exploring the potential contribution of the
      interactions of the components is recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing facilitators
      and barriers to use of health information exchange (HIE). METHODS: We searched
      MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases between January
      1990 and February 2015 using terms related to HIE. English-language studies that 
      identified barriers and facilitators of actual HIE were included. Data on study
      design, risk of bias, setting, geographic location, characteristics of the HIE,
      perceived barriers and facilitators to use were extracted and confirmed. RESULTS:
      Ten cross-sectional, seven multiple-site case studies, and two before-after
      studies that included data from several sources (surveys, interviews, focus
      groups, and observations of users) evaluated perceived barriers and facilitators 
      to HIE use. The most commonly cited barriers to HIE use were incomplete
      information, inefficient workflow, and reports that the exchanged information
      that did not meet the needs of users. The review identified several facilitators 
      to use. DISCUSSION: Incomplete patient information was consistently mentioned in 
      the studies conducted in the US but not mentioned in the few studies conducted
      outside of the US that take a collective approach toward healthcare. Individual
      patients and practices in the US may exercise the right to participate (or not)
      in HIE which effects the completeness of patient information available to be
      exchanged. Workflow structure and user roles are key but understudied.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified several facilitators in the studies that showed
      promise in promoting electronic health data exchange: obtaining more complete
      patient information; thoughtful workflow that folds in HIE; and inclusion of
      users early in implementation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the recent literature and research and present a
      selection of the best papers published in 2017 in the field of Health Information
      Management (HIM) and Health Informatics. METHODS: A systematic review of the
      literature was performed by the two HIM section editors of the International
      Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook with the help of a medical
      librarian. We searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers using both 
      MeSH descriptors and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15
      candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being
      peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. RESULTS: Health Information
      Exchange was a major theme within candidate best papers. The four papers
      ultimately selected as 'Best Papers' represent themes that include health
      information exchange, governance and policy issues, results of health information
      exchange, and methods of integrating information from multiple sources. Other
      articles within the candidate best papers include these themes as well as those
      focusing on authentication and de-identification and usability of information
      systems. CONCLUSIONS: The papers discussed in the HIM section of IMIA Yearbook
      reflect the overall theme of the 2018 edition of the Yearbook, i.e., the tension 
      between privacy and access to information. While most of the papers focused on
      health information exchange, which reflects the "access" side of the equation,
      most of the others addressed privacy issues. This synopsis discusses these key
      issues at the intersection of HIM and informatics.

TI  - The Effect of Perioperative E-Health Interventions on the Postoperative Course: A
      Systematic Review of Randomised and Non-Randomised Controlled Trials.
PG  - e0158612
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: E-health interventions have become increasingly popular, including in
      perioperative care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      perioperative e-health interventions on the postoperative course. METHODS: We
      conducted a systematic review and searched for relevant articles in the PUBMED,
      EMBASE, CINAHL and COCHRANE databases. Controlled trials written in English, with
      participants of 18 years and older who underwent any type of surgery and which
      evaluated any type of e-health intervention by reporting patient-related outcome 
      measures focusing on the period after surgery, were included. Data of all
      included studies were extracted and study quality was assessed by using the Downs
      and Black scoring system. FINDINGS: A total of 33 articles were included,
      reporting on 27 unique studies. Most studies were judged as having a medium risk 
      of bias (n = 13), 11 as a low risk of bias, and three as high risk of bias
      studies. Most studies included patients undergoing cardiac (n = 9) or orthopedic 
      surgery (n = 7). All studies focused on replacing (n = 11) or complementing (n = 
      15) perioperative usual care with some form of care via ICT; one study evaluated 
      both type of interventions. Interventions consisted of an educational or
      supportive website, telemonitoring, telerehabilitation or teleconsultation. All
      studies measured patient-related outcomes focusing on the physical, the mental or
      the general component of recovery. 11 studies (40.7%) reported outcome measures
      related to the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of health care usage
      and costs. 25 studies (92.6%) reported at least an equal (n = 8) or positive (n =
      17) effect of the e-health intervention compared to usual care. In two studies
      (7.4%) a positive effect on any outcome was found in favour of the control group.
      CONCLUSION: Based on this systematic review we conclude that in the majority of
      the studies e-health leads to similar or improved clinical patient-related
      outcomes compared to only face to face perioperative care for patients who have
      undergone various forms of surgery. However, due to the low or moderate quality
      of many studies, the results should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Understanding the patient privacy perspective on health information exchange: A
      systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE), the ability for health information
      technology (HIT) to share patient data, can improve the efficiency and
      effectiveness of healthcare; however, this ability may cause patient concern
      about their ability to control who can access their health records (i.e.,
      privacy). These concerns may affect a patient's candor in their therapeutic
      patient-provider relationships, thereby undermining their care. While patient
      privacy concerns are often cited as a barrier to HIT implementation, the patient 
      privacy perspective is not well understood. The purpose of this systematic review
      is to provide an in-depth exploration of the patient privacy perspective toward
      HIE, its antecedents, and its outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic
      review was conducted on seven health sciences and interdisciplinary databases.
      Empirical studies that assessed the patient perception of privacy in context of
      interoperable HIT were included. All included articles were independently
      screened, extracted, and analyzed by two reviewers. The results were extracted
      and categorized based on the dimensions outlined in the Antecedent Privacy
      Concern Outcomes macro-model (APCO). RESULTS: Of the 1713 unique citations, 59
      articles met the inclusion criteria which consisted of 39 (66.1%) quantitative
      studies, 15 (25.4%) qualitative studies, and 5 (8.5%) mixed methods studies.
      Fourteen articles (23.7%) were specifically focused on understanding privacy. The
      patient privacy perspective was operationalized in different ways, with privacy
      concern being the most common measure (25.4%). The percentage of participants
      expressing privacy concern ranged from 15% to 74%, depending on the study.
      Perceived quality of care was associated with lower privacy concerns. Privacy
      concerns were associated with privacy protective behaviours; however, the
      perceived benefit of HIE may mitigate the effects of privacy concern. CONCLUSION:
      Using the APCO as a guide, this review found that the patient privacy perspective
      is dynamic, complex, and still not well understood. There may be an
      oversimplification of the patient privacy perspective and its impact given the
      paucity of privacy-focused research. The evidence suggests patient perceptions of
      healthcare and the value of HIE are important factors in mitigating privacy
      concerns and its effects. More in-depth privacy studies are required to further
      illuminate the nuances of the patient perspective and provide policy-makers with 
      greater insights on the privacy barrier.

TI  - How to keep up to date with medical information using web-based resources: a
      systematised review and narrative synthesis.
PG  - 254-292
LID - 10.1111/hir.12318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Keeping up to date with the latest medical information using
      Web-based resources has been sparsely described, and a comprehensive up-to-date
      review is needed. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the Web-based 'channels' that may
      assist the actors of the health care system (clinicians, medical researchers and 
      students) to keep up to date with medical information. METHODS: We searched
      PubMed and Scopus for English language articles published between January 1990
      and February 2019 that investigated ways for keeping up with medical information.
      We used the results from our search and relevant information from other sources
      to conduct a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We found that resources that push
      information (e.g. web alerts, medical newsletters, listservs), resources that
      rely on the active information seeking (e.g. access to health librarians and
      electronic databases, podcasts, mobile apps), collaborative resources (e.g. web
      conferences, online journal clubs, web social media) and resources that
      synthesise information (e.g. bibliometrics, living systematic reviews) can
      contribute in keeping up with new findings and can enhance evidence-based
      medicine. Clinicians, medical researchers and students can benefit from the
      proper use of such Internet-based technological innovations. CONCLUSION: Internet
      provides many resources that can help the actors of the health care system stay
      up to date with the latest scientific findings.

TI  - The Use of Health Information Exchange to Augment Patient Handoff in Long-Term
      Care: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 752-771
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1670651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Legislation aimed at increasing the use of a health information
      exchange (HIE) in healthcare has excluded long-term care facilities, resulting in
      a vulnerable patient population that can benefit from the improvement of
      communication and reduction of waste. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to
      provide a framework for future research by identifying themes in the long-term
      care information technology sector that could function to enable the adoption and
      use of HIE mechanisms for patient handoff between long-term care facilities and
      other levels of care to increase communication between providers, shorten length 
      of stay, reduce 60-day readmissions, and increase patient safety. METHODS: The
      authors conducted a systematic search of literature through CINAHL, PubMed, and
      Discovery Services for Texas A&M University Libraries. Search terms used were
      ("health information exchange" OR "healthcare information exchange" OR "HIE") AND
      ("long term care" OR "long-term care" OR "nursing home" OR "nursing facility" OR 
      "skilled nursing facility" OR "SNF" OR "residential care" OR "assisted living"). 
      Articles were eligible for selection if they were published between 2010 and
      2017, published in English, and published in academic journals. All articles were
      reviewed by all reviewers and literature not relevant to the research objective
      was excluded. RESULTS: Researchers selected and reviewed 22 articles for common
      themes. Results concluded that the largest facilitator and barrier to the
      adoption of HIE mechanisms is workflow integration/augmentation and the
      organizational structure/culture, respectively. Other identified facilitator
      themes were enhanced communication, increased effectiveness of care, and patient 
      safety. The additional barriers were missing/incomplete data, inefficiency, and
      market conditions. CONCLUSION: The long-term care industry has been left out of
      incentives from which the industry could have benefited tremendously.
      Organizations that are not utilizing health information technology mechanisms,
      such as electronic health records and HIEs, are at a disadvantage as insurers
      switch to capitated forms of payment that rely on reduced waste to generate a
      profit.

TI  - Electronic health records in a Blockchain: A systematic review.
PG  - 1273-1288
LID - 10.1177/1460458219866350 [doi]
AB  - Blockchain could reinvent the way patient's electronic health records are shared 
      and stored by providing safer mechanisms for health information exchange of
      medical data in the healthcare industry, by securing it over a decentralized
      peer-to-peer network. Intending to support and ease the understanding of this
      distributed ledger technology, a solid Systematic Literature Review was
      conducted, aiming to explore the recent literature on Blockchain and healthcare
      domain and identify existing challenges and open questions, guided by the raise
      of research questions regarding EHR in a Blockchain. More than 300 scientific
      studies published in the last ten years were surveyed, resulting in an up-to-date
      taxonomy creation, challenges and open questions identified, and the most
      significant approaches, data types, standards and architectures regarding the use
      of Blockchain for EHR were assessed and discussed.

PG  - 84-90
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1726501 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize the recent literature and research and present a
      selection of the best papers published in 2020 in the field of Health Information
      Management (HIM) and Health Informatics. METHODS: A systematic review of the
      literature for the IMIA Yearbook HIM section was performed by the two section
      editors with the help of a medical librarian. We searched bibliographic databases
      for HIM-related papers using both MeSH headings and keywords in titles and
      abstracts. A shortlist of the fifteen best candidate papers was first selected by
      section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers.
      RESULTS: The three major themes of Health Information Exchange (transmitting,
      sharing, and accessing patient health-related data and information) (HIE), Data
      Quality, and Privacy and Security make up 80% of the fifteen papers, with
      individual papers on personal health records, information governance and the
      professionalism of the HIM field. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional HIM concerns about HIM
      practice and workforce as well as issues about the data in electronic health
      records (EHRs) including data quality, coding, health information exchange among 
      entities within the healthcare systems and privacy and confidentiality continue
      to be a large part of the HIM research literature. Although there was little
      research applying these themes to pandemic concerns, HIM professionals have the
      expertise to make ccontributions to public health informatics research and this
      research would benefit from their involvement.

TI  - Design Choices and Trade-Offs in Health Care Blockchain Implementations:
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e12426
LID - 10.2196/12426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A blockchain is a list of records that uses cryptography to make
      stored data immutable; their use has recently been proposed for electronic
      medical record (EMR) systems. This paper details a systematic review of
      trade-offs in blockchain technologies that are relevant to EMRs. Trade-offs are
      defined as "a compromise between two desirable but incompatible features."
      OBJECTIVE: This review's primary research question was: "What are the trade-offs 
      involved in different blockchain designs that are relevant to the creation of
      blockchain-based electronic medical records systems?" METHODS: Seven databases
      were systematically searched for relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Papers published from
      January 1, 2017 to June 15, 2018 were selected. Quality assessments of papers
      were performed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions 
      (ROBINS-I) tool and the Critical Assessment Skills Programme (CASP) tool.
      Database searches identified 2885 articles, of which 15 were ultimately included 
      for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 17 trade-offs were identified impacting the
      design, development, and implementation of blockchain systems; these trade-offs
      are organized into themes, including business, application, data, and technology 
      architecture. CONCLUSIONS: The key findings concluded the following: (1) multiple
      trade-offs can be managed adaptively to improve EMR utility; (2) multiple
      trade-offs involve improving the security of blockchain systems at the cost of
      other features, meaning EMR efficacy highly depends on data protection standards;
      and (3) multiple trade-offs result in improved blockchain scalability.
      Consideration of these trade-offs will be important to the specific environment
      in which electronic medical records are being developed. This review also uses
      its findings to suggest useful design choices for a hypothetical National Health 
      Service blockchain. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID):

TI  - Electronic palliative care coordination systems (EPaCCS): a systematic review.
PG  - 68-78
LID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001689 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically search, evaluate and report the state of the
      science of electronic palliative care coordination systems (EPaCCS). METHODS: We 
      searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and grey literature for
      articles evaluating or discussing electronic systems to facilitate sharing of
      information about advance care plans. Two independent review authors screened
      full-text articles for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. RESULTS:
      In total, 30 articles and reports were included. Of the 26 articles, 14 were
      'expert opinion' articles (editorials, discussion papers or commentaries), 9 were
      observational studies (cross-sectional, retrospective cohort studies or service
      evaluations), 2 were qualitative studies and 1 a mixed-methods study. No study
      had an experimental design. Quantitative studies described the proportion of
      people with EPaCCS dying in their preferred place, and associations between
      EPaCCS use and hospital utilisation. Qualitative, mixed-methods studies and
      reports described the burden of inputting data and difficulties with IT systems
      as main challenges of implementing EPaCCS. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the current
      scientific literature on EPaCCS comprises expert opinion, and there is an absence
      of experimental studies evaluating the impact of EPaCCS on end-of-life outcomes. 
      Given the current drive for national roll-out of EPaCCS by 2020, it is essential 
      that rigorous evaluation of EPaCCS is prioritised.

TI  - Describing knowledge encounters in healthcare: a mixed studies systematic review 
      and development of a classification.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s13012-017-0564-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation science seeks to promote the uptake of research and
      other evidence-based findings into practice, but for healthcare professionals,
      this is complex as practice draws on, in addition to scientific principles, rules
      of thumb and a store of practical wisdom acquired from a range of informational
      and experiential sources. The aims of this review were to identify sources of
      information and professional experiences encountered by healthcare workers and
      from this to build a classification system, for use in future observational
      studies, that describes influences on how healthcare professionals acquire and
      use information in their clinical practice. METHODS: This was a mixed studies
      systematic review of observational studies. DATA SOURCES: OVID MEDLINE and Embase
      and Google Scholar were searched using terms around information, knowledge or
      evidence and sharing, searching and utilisation combined with terms relating to
      healthcare groups. ELIGIBILITY: Studies were eligible if one of the intentions
      was to identify information or experiential encounters by healthcare workers.
      DATA EXTRACTION: Data was extracted by one author after piloting with another.
      STUDY APPRAISAL: Studies were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool
      (MMAT). PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome extracted was the information source
      or professional experience encounter. ANALYSIS: Similar encounters were grouped
      together as single constructs. Our synthesis involved a mixed approach using the 
      top-down logic of the Bliss Bibliographic Classification System (BC2) to generate
      classification categories and a bottom-up approach to develop descriptive codes
      (or "facets") for each category, from the data. The generic terms of BC2 were
      customised by an iterative process of thematic content analysis. Facets were
      developed by using available theory and keeping in mind the pragmatic end use of 
      the classification. RESULTS: Eighty studies were included from which 178 discreet
      knowledge encounters were extracted. Six classification categories were
      developed: what information or experience was encountered; how was the
      information or experience encountered; what was the mode of encounter; from whom 
      did the information originate or with whom was the experience; how many
      participants were there; and where did the encounter take place. For each of
      these categories, relevant descriptive facets were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We
      have sought to identify and classify all knowledge encounters, and we have
      developed a faceted description of key categories which will support richer
      descriptions and interrogations of knowledge encounters in healthcare research.

AB  - The availability of research and outcomes data is the primary limitation to
      evidence-based practice. Today, only a fraction of clinical decisions are based
      upon evidence derived from randomized control trials (RCTs), the gold-standard of
      knowledge discovery. At the same time, clinical trial complexity has steadily
      increased as has the effort required at clinical investigational sites. Direct
      use of electronic health record (EHR) data for clinical trials has the potential 
      to address some of these needs, improving data quality and reducing cost.

AB  - Objectives: To summarize the recent literature and research and present a
      selection of the best papers published in 2016 in the field of Health Information
      Management (HIM). Methods: A systematic review of the literature for the IMIA
      Yearbook HIM section was performed by the two section editors with the help of a 
      medical librarian. We searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers
      were searched using both MeSH headings and key words in titles and abstracts. A
      shortlist of candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before
      being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Results: The five papers
      selected as 'Best Papers' illustrate a variety of themes, include authors from a 
      variety of countries, and were published in some of the best journals in the
      field. The themes of the five best papers include health information exchange,
      personal health records, patient engagement, data quality, and e-quality
      measures. Conclusions: The discipline of Health Information Management is
      increasingly becoming allied with the field of Biomedical Informatics in that
      both disciplines have interests in common. Traditional HIM areas of expertise (in
      the pre-electronic health record world), such as coding and privacy and security 
      of health information, are necessary for the electronic exchange and secondary
      use of health information. With the changes in healthcare delivery brought by the
      use of electronic health records, addressing issues of information governance is 
      essential. This synopsis discusses these key issues at the intersection of HIM
      and informatics, examines the potential challenges, and points the way for best
      practices, future research, and public policy considerations and directions.
