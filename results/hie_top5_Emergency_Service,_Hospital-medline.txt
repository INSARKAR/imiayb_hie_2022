AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are associated with inefficient and
      fragmented use of healthcare services. The Chesapeake Regional Information System
      for Our Patients, Inc. (CRISP) is a Health Information Exchange (HIE) linking
      disparate systems of care in the mid-Atlantic region. METHODS: This article
      describes applications of HIE for tracking hospital service utilization in
      substance use disorder clinical and services research, drawing upon data from one
      of the first studies approved to access the CRISP HIE. Participants were 200
      medical/surgical inpatients with comorbid opioid, cocaine, and/or alcohol use
      disorder (45.5 % female; 56.5 % black; 77.5 % opioid use disorder; 42.0 %
      homeless). This study compared HIE-identified hospital service utilization with
      conventional methods of participant self-report during in-person research
      follow-ups (3-, 6-, and 12-months post-discharge) and electronic health record
      (EHR) review from the hospital system of the index admission. RESULTS: This
      sample exhibited high levels of hospital utilization, which would have been
      underestimated using conventional methods. Relying exclusively on self-report in 
      the 12-month observation period would have identified only 33.8 % of 429
      inpatient hospitalizations and 9.0 % of 1,287 ED visits, due to both
      loss-to-follow-up and failure to report events. Even combining self-report with
      single-system EHR review identified only 66.2 % of inpatient hospitalizations and
      59.8 % of ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: CRISP HIE data were superior to conventional
      methods for ascertaining hospital service utilization in this sample of patients 
      exhibiting high-volume and fragmented care. The use of HIE holds implications for
      improving rigor, safety, and efficiency in research studies.

AB  - Prior research on health information exchange (HIE) typically measured provider
      usage through surveys or they summarized the availability of HIE services in a
      healthcare organization. Few studies utilized user log files. Using HIE access
      log files, we measured HIE use in real-world clinical settings over a 7-year
      period (2011-2017). Use of HIE increased in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency 
      department (ED) settings. Further, while extant literature has generally viewed
      the ED as the most relevant setting for HIE, the greatest change in HIE use was
      observed in the inpatient setting, followed by the ED setting and then the
      outpatient setting. Our findings suggest that in addition to federal incentives, 
      the implementation of features that address barriers to access (eg, Single Sign
      On), as well as value-added services (eg, interoperability with external data
      sources), may be related to the growth in user-initiated HIE.

TI  - A snapshot of health information exchange across five nations: an investigation
      of frontline clinician experiences in emergency care.
PG  - 686-693
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx153 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Ensuring the ability to exchange patient information among disparate
      electronic health records systems is a top priority and a domain of substantial
      public investment across countries. However, we know little about the extent to
      which current capabilities meet the needs of frontline clinicians. Materials and 
      Methods: We conducted in-person, semistructured interviews with emergency care
      physicians and nurses in select hospitals in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
      and the USA. We characterized the state of health information exchange (HIE) by
      country and used thematic analysis to identify the perceived benefits of access
      to complete past medical history (PMH), the conditions under which PMH is sought,
      and the challenges to accessing and using HIE capabilities. Results: HIE
      approaches, and the information electronically accessible to clinicians, differed
      by country. Benefits of access to PMH included safer care, reduced patient length
      of stay, and fewer lab and imaging orders. Conditions under which PMH was sought 
      included moderate-acuity patients, patients with chronic conditions, and
      instances where accessing PMH was convenient. Challenges to HIE access and use
      included difficulty knowing where information is located, delay in receiving
      information, and difficulty finding information within documents. Discussion:
      Even with different HIE approaches across countries, all clinicians reported
      shortcomings in their country's approach. Notably, challenges were similar and
      shaped the conditions under which PMH was sought. Conclusion: As countries
      continue to pursue broad-based HIE, they appear to be facing similar challenges
      in realizing HIE value and therefore have an opportunity to learn from one
      another.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of machine learning techniques is especially pertinent to the
      composite and challenging conditions of emergency departments (EDs). Repeat ED
      visits (i.e. revisits) are an example of potentially inappropriate utilization of
      resources that can be forecasted by these techniques. OBJECTIVE: To track the ED 
      revisit risk over time using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a major latent
      class model. Given the HMM states, we carried out forecasting of future ED
      revisits with various data mining models. METHODS: Information integrated from
      four distributed sources (e.g. electronic health records and health information
      exchange) was integrated into four HMMs which capture the relationships between
      an observed and a hidden progression that shift over time through a series of
      hidden states in an adult patient population. RESULTS: Assimilating a
      pre-analysis of the various patients by applying latent class models and
      directing them to well-known classifiers functioned well. The performance was
      significantly better than without utilizing pre-analysis of HMM for all
      prediction models (classifiers(. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that one
      prospective approach to advanced risk prediction is to leverage the longitudinal 
      nature of health care data by exploiting patients' between state variation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interoperable health information technologies, like electronic
      health records (EHR) and health information exchange (HIE), provide greater
      access to patient information from across multiple organizations. Also, an
      increasing number of public data sources exist to describe social determinant of 
      health factors. These data may help better inform risk prediction models, but the
      relative importance or value of these data has not been established. This study
      assessed the performance of different classes of information individually, and in
      combination, in predicting emergency department (ED) revisits. METHODS: In a
      sample of 279,611 adult ED encounters. We compared the performance of Two-Class
      Boosted Decision Trees machine learning algorithm using 5 classes of information:
      1) social determinants of health measures only, 2) current visit EHR information 
      only, 3) current and historical EHR information, 4) HIE information only, and 5) 
      all available information combined. RESULTS: The social determinants of health
      measure only model had the overall worst performance with an area under the curve
      AUC of 0.61. The model using all information classes together had the best
      performance (AUC=0.732). The model using HIE information only performed better
      than all other single information class models. CONCLUSIONS: Broad information
      sources, which are reflective of patients' reliance on multiple organizations for
      care, better support risk prediction modeling in the emergency department.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Frequent emergency department (ED) users are of interest to
      policymakers and hospitals. The objective of this study is to examine the effect 
      of health information exchange size on the identification of frequent ED users.
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from Healthix, a health information
      exchange in New York that previously included 10 hospitals and then grew to 31
      hospitals. We divided patients into 3 cohorts: high-frequency ED users with 4 or 
      more visits in any 30-day period, medium-frequency ED users with 4 or more visits
      in any year, and infrequent ED users with fewer than 4 visits in any year. For
      both the smaller (10-hospital) and larger (31-hospital) health information
      exchanges, we compared the identification rate of frequent ED users that was
      based on hospital-specific data with the corresponding rates that were based on
      health information exchange data. RESULTS: The smaller health information
      exchange (n=1,696,279 unique ED patients) identified 11.4% more high-frequency
      users (33,467 versus 30,057) and 9.5% more medium-frequency users (109,497 versus
      100,014) than the hospital-specific data. The larger health information exchange 
      (n=3,684,999) identified 19.6% more high-frequency patients (52,727 versus
      44,079) and 18.2% more medium-frequency patients (222,574 versus 192,541) than
      the hospital-specific data. Expanding from the smaller health information
      exchange to the larger one, we found an absolute increase of 8.2% and 8.7%
      identified high- and medium-frequency users, respectively. CONCLUSION: Increasing
      health information exchange size more accurately reflects how patients access EDs
      and ultimately improves not only the total number of identified frequent ED users
      but also their identification rate.

TI  - End user information needs for a SMART on FHIR-based automated transfer form to
      support the care of nursing home patients during emergency department visits.
PG  - 1239-1248
AB  - Nursing home (NH) patients are extensive users of emergency department (ED)
      services. Problematically, poor information sharing and incomplete access to
      information complicates the delivery of care in EDs for NH patients. Paper-based 
      transfer forms can support information sharing, but have significant limitations.
      Standards-based automated transfer-forms that leverage health information
      exchange data may address the limitations of paper-based forms and better support
      care delivery. This study developed a prototype SMART on FHIR automated transfer 
      form for NH patients using priority data elements identified through individual
      interviews, a review of existing transfer forms, a targeted survey of end users, 
      and a design workshop. Analyses were grounded in the 5 Rights of clinical
      decision support framework. The most valuable data elements included: emergency
      contact/healthcare proxy, current medication list, reason for transfer to the ED,
      baseline neurological state, and relevant diagnoses / medical history. The
      working prototype was successfully deployed within an Amazon Web Service
      environment.

TI  - Bouncing Back Elsewhere: Multilevel Analysis of Return Visits to the Same or a
      Different Hospital After Initial Emergency Department Presentation.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Analyses of 72-hour emergency department (ED) return visits are 
      frequently used for quality assurance purposes and have been proposed as a means 
      of measuring provider performance. These analyses have traditionally examined
      only patients returning to the same hospital as the initial visit. We use a
      health information exchange network to describe differences between ED visits
      resulting in 72-hour revisits to the same hospital and those resulting in
      revisits to a different site. METHODS: We examined data from a 31-hospital health
      information exchange of all ED visits during a 5-year period to identify 72-hour 
      return visits and collected available encounter, patient, and hospital variables.
      Next, we used multilevel analysis of encounter-level, patient-level, and
      hospital-level data to describe differences between initial ED visits resulting
      in different-site and same-site return visits. RESULTS: We identified 12,621,159 
      patient visits to the 31 study EDs, including 841,259 same-site and 107,713
      different-site return visits within 72 hours of initial ED presentation. We
      calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
      initial-visit characteristics' predictive relationship that any return visit
      would be at a different site: daytime visit (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.12),
      patient-hospital county concordance (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.44), male sex (OR 
      1.27; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.30), aged 65 years or older (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.53 to
      0.57), sites with an ED residency (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.43), sites at an
      academic hospital (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.15), sites with high density of
      surrounding EDs (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.68 to 1.77), and sites with a high frequency
      of same-site return visits (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.11). CONCLUSION: This
      analysis describes how ED encounters with early revisits to the same hospital
      differ from those with revisits to a second hospital. These findings challenge
      the use of single-site return-visit frequency as a quality measure, and, more
      constructively, describe how hospitals can use health information exchange to
      more accurately identify early ED return visits and to support programs related
      to these revisits.

TI  - Enabling health information exchange at a US Poison Control Center.
PG  - 1000-1006
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa055 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was to enable poison control center
      (PCC) participation in standards-based health information exchange (HIE).
      Previously, PCC participation was not possible due to software noncompliance with
      HIE standards, lack of informatics infrastructure, and the need to integrate HIE 
      processes into workflow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted the Health Level Seven
      Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) consultation note for the PCC
      use case. We used rapid prototyping to determine requirements for an HIE
      dashboard for use by PCCs and developed software called SNOWHITE that enables
      poison center HIE in tandem with a poisoning information system. RESULTS: We
      successfully implemented the process and software at the PCC and began sending
      outbound C-CDAs from the Utah PCC on February 15, 2017; we began receiving
      inbound C-CDAs on October 30, 2018. DISCUSSION: With the creation of SNOWHITE and
      initiation of an HIE process for sending outgoing C-CDA consultation notes from
      the Utah Poison Control Center, we accomplished the first participation of PCCs
      in standards-based HIE in the US. We faced several challenges that are also
      likely to be present at PCCs in other states, including the lack of a robust set 
      of patient identifiers to support automated patient identity matching, challenges
      in emergency department computerized workflow integration, and the need to build 
      HIE software for PCCs. CONCLUSION: As a multi-disciplinary, multi-organizational 
      team, we successfully developed both a process and the informatics tools
      necessary to enable PCC participation in standards-based HIE and implemented the 
      process at the Utah PCC.

TI  - Long-term evaluation of a hospital-based violence intervention program using a
      regional health information exchange.
PG  - 175-182
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001671 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIP) aim to reduce
      violent-injury recidivism by providing intensive case management services to
      high-risk patients who were violently injured. Although HVIP have been found
      effective at reducing recidivism, few studies have sought to identity how long
      their effects last. Additionally, prior studies have been limited by the fact
      that HVIP typically rely on self-report or data within their own healthcare
      system to identify new injuries. Our aim was to quantify the long-term recidivism
      rate of participants in an HVIP program using more objective and comprehensive
      data from a regional health information exchange. METHODS: The study included 328
      patients enrolled in Prescription for Hope (RxH), an HVIP, between January 2009
      and August 2016. We obtained RxH participants' emergency department (ED)
      encounter data from a regional health information exchange database from the date
      of hospital discharge to February 2017. Our primary outcome was violent-injury
      recidivism rate of the RxH program. We also examined reasons for ED visits that
      were unrelated to violent injury. RESULTS: We calculated a 4.4% recidivism rate
      based on 8 years of statewide data, containing 1,575 unique encounters. More than
      96% of participants were matched in the state database. Of the 15 patients who
      recidivated, only five were admitted for their injury. More than half of new
      violence-related injuries were treated outside of the HVIP-affiliated trauma
      center. The most common reasons for ED visits were pain (718 encounters),
      followed by suspected complications or needing additional postoperative care (181
      encounters). Substance abuse, unintentional injuries, and suicidal ideation were 
      also frequent reasons for ED visits. CONCLUSION: The low, long-term recidivism
      rate for RxH indicates that HVIPs have enduring positive effects on the majority 
      of participants. Our results suggest that HVIP may further benefit patients by
      partnering with organizations that work to prevent suicide, substance use
      disorders, and other unintentional injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic
      study, level III.

TI  - Impact of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program on Health Information Exchange
      Utilization, Prescribing Behaviors, and Care Coordination in an Emergency
      Department.

LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000566 [doi]
AB  - Timely access to patient data is critical in patient care. The utilization of
      health information exchange and prescription drug monitoring programs can make
      pertinent data readily accessible for emergency department providers to
      coordinate care. A quasi-experimental preintervention-postintervention design,
      with 62 providers and 53 554 emergency department visits linked to a health
      information exchange and prescription drug monitoring program, was used to
      evaluate rates for utilization, laboratory/imaging orders, narcotic prescribing
      and readmission. Health information exchange utilization increased significantly 
      after the drug monitoring program was implemented (mean = 119.33 to mean =
      231.33, t2 = -15.79, P < .001). There was no significant effect postprescription 
      drug monitoring program for laboratory/imaging orders or narcotics at discharge, 
      although narcotic orders during emergency visits increased (F1,23 = 7.953, P =
      .010), which may suggest the data confirmed the immediate need to control acute
      or chronic conditions. In addition, readmission rates decreased from 14.64% to
      12.58%. Through streamlining processes, health information exchange and
      prescription drug monitoring program usage were increased, which can improve
      care. As organizations promote interoperability of health information, the nurse 
      informaticist plays a significant role in managing access to systems that can
      assist all providers in coordinating care.

TI  - Human-centered development of an electronic health record-embedded, interactive
      information visualization in the emergency department using fast healthcare
      interoperability resources.
PG  - 1401-1410
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate an interactive information visualization embedded
      within the electronic health record (EHR) by following human-centered design
      (HCD) processes and leveraging modern health information exchange standards.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied an HCD process to develop a Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application that displays a patient's asthma
      history to clinicians in a pediatric emergency department. We performed a
      preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number
      of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction,
      and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality 
      were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end
      users. RESULTS: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated
      a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P < .001), number of
      screens (P < .001), and cognitive load (P < .001) for clinicians when compared to
      base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable
      functionality and high user satisfaction. DISCUSSION: Following HCD processes to 
      develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement 
      is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges
      associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as
      currently implemented. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our
      visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of
      pediatric asthma patients. Application development efforts in an operational
      context should leverage existing health information exchange standards, such as
      FHIR, and evidence-based mixed methods approaches.

TI  - Regional data exchange to improve care for veterans after non-VA hospitalization:
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0849-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordination of care, especially after a patient experiences an acute
      care event, is a challenge for many health systems. Event notification is a form 
      of health information exchange (HIE) which has the potential to support care
      coordination by alerting primary care providers when a patient experiences an
      acute care event. While promising, there exists little evidence on the impact of 
      event notification in support of reengagement into primary care. The objectives
      of this study are to 1) examine the effectiveness of event notification on health
      outcomes for older adults who experience acute care events, and 2) compare
      approaches to how providers respond to event notifications. METHODS: In a cluster
      randomized trial conducted across two medical centers within the U.S. Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA) system, we plan to enroll older patients (>/= 65
      years of age) who utilize both VHA and non-VHA providers. Patients will be
      enrolled into one of three arms: 1) usual care; 2) event notifications only; or
      3) event notifications plus a care transitions intervention. In the event
      notification arms, following a non-VHA acute care encounter, an HIE-based
      intervention will send an event notification to VHA providers. Patients in the
      event notification plus care transitions arm will also receive 30 days of care
      transition support from a social worker. The primary outcome measure is 90-day
      readmission rate. Secondary outcomes will be high risk medication discrepancies
      as well as care transitions processes within the VHA health system. Qualitative
      assessments of the intervention will inform VHA system-wide implementation.
      DISCUSSION: While HIE has been evaluated in other contexts, little evidence
      exists on HIE-enabled event notification interventions. Furthermore, this trial
      offers the opportunity to examine the use of event notifications that trigger a
      care transitions intervention to further support coordination of care. TRIAL

TI  - Perceptions of Radiologists and Emergency Medicine Providers Regarding the
      Quality, Value, and Challenges of Outside Image Sharing in the Emergency
      Department Setting.
PG  - 843-852
LID - 10.2214/AJR.19.22096 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to assess the perceptions of radiologists
      and emergency medicine (EM) providers regarding the quality, value, and
      challenges associated with using outside imaging (i.e., images obtained at
      facilities other than their own institution). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We surveyed 
      radiologists and EM providers at a large academic medical center regarding their 
      perceptions of the availability and utility of outside imaging. RESULTS.
      Thirty-four of 101 radiologists (33.6%) and 38 of 197 EM providers (19.3%)
      responded. A total of 32.4% of radiologists and 55.3% of EM providers had
      confidence in the quality of images from outside community facilities; 20.6% and 
      44.7%, respectively, had confidence in the interpretations of radiologists from
      these outside facilities. Only 23.5% of radiologists and 5.3% of EM physicians
      were confident in their ability to efficiently access reports (for outside
      images, 47.1% and 5.3%). Very few radiologists and EM providers had accessed
      imaging reports from outside facilities through an available stand-alone portal. 
      A total of 40.6% of radiologists thought that outside reports always or
      frequently reduced additional imaging recommendations (62.5% for outside images);
      15.6% thought that reports changed interpretations of new examinations (37.5% for
      outside images); and 43.8% thought that reports increased confidence in
      interpretations of new examinations (75.0% for outside images). A total of 29.4% 
      of EM providers thought that access to reports from outside facilities reduced
      repeat imaging (64.7% for outside images), 41.2% thought that they changed
      diagnostic or management plans (50.0% for outside images), and 50.0% thought they
      increased clinical confidence (67.6% for outside images). CONCLUSION.
      Radiologists and EM providers perceive high value in sharing images from outside 
      facilities, despite quality concerns. Substantial challenges exist in accessing
      these images and reports from outside facilities, and providers are unlikely to
      do so using separate systems. However, even if information technology solutions
      for seamless image integration are adopted, providers' lack of confidence in
      outside studies may remain an important barrier.
