TI  - Racial differences in patient consent policy preferences for electronic health
      information exchange.
PG  - 717-725
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between demographic
      variables, such as race and gender, and patient consent policy preferences for
      health information exchange as well as self-report by VHA enrollees of
      information continuity between Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and community
      non-VHA heath care providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected between 
      March 25, 2016 and August 22, 2016 in an online survey of 19 567 veterans. Three 
      questions from the 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey,
      which addressed care continuity, were included. The survey also included
      questions about consent policy preference regarding opt-out, opt-in, and "break
      the glass" consent policies. RESULTS: VHA enrollees had comparable proportions of
      unnecessary laboratory testing and conflicting information from providers when
      compared with the United States sample in the Commonwealth Survey. However, they 
      endorsed medical record information being unavailable between organizations more 
      highly. Demographic variables were associated with gaps in care continuity as
      well as consent policy preferences, with 56.8% of Whites preferring an opt-out
      policy as compared with 40.3% of Blacks, 44.9% of Hispanic Latinos, 48.3% of
      Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 38.3% of Native Americans (P < .001). DISCUSSION:
      Observed large differences by race and ethnicity in privacy preferences for
      electronic health information exchange should inform implementation of these
      programs to ensure cultural sensitivity. Veterans experienced care continuity
      comparable to a general United States sample, except for less effective exchange 
      of health records between heath care organizations. VHA followed an opt-in
      consent policy at the time of this survey which may underlie this gap.

AB  - Medical data are important in diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and medical
      accident investigation. The integrity and availability of medical data are the
      basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of
      medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At
      present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One
      way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control
      strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the
      patient's key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method
      is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem
      with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies
      during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the
      availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be
      reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and
      treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted
      and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the
      integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the
      sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses 
      the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the
      system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF 
      to a blockchain application.

AB  - Health information exchanges (HIEs) are multisided platforms that facilitate the 
      sharing of patient health information (PHI) between providers and payers across
      organizations within a region, community or hospital system. The benefits of HIEs
      to payers and providers include lower cost, faster services, and better health
      outcome. However, most HIEs have configured the patient healthcare consent
      process to give all providers who sign up with the exchange access to PHI for all
      consenting patients, leaving no control to patients in customized what
      information to share and with who. This research investigates the impact of
      granting greater control to patients in sharing their personal health information
      on consent rates and making them active participants in the HIEs system. This
      research utilizes a randomized experimental survey design study. The study uses
      responses from 388 participants and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test
      the conceptual model. The main findings of this research include that patients
      consent rate increases significantly when greater control in sharing PHI is
      offered to the patient. In addition, greater control reduces the negative impact 
      of privacy concern on the intention to consent. Similarly, trust in healthcare
      professionals leads to higher consent when greater control is offered to the
      patient. Thus, greater control empowers the role of trust in engaging patients
      and sustaining HIEs. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research by
      extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model.
      The findings impact practice by providing insights that will help sustain HIEs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Secondary usage of patient data has recently become of increasing
      interest for the development and application of computer analytic techniques.
      Strict oversight of these data is required and the individual patients themselves
      are integral to providing guidance. We sought to understand patients' attitudes
      to sharing their imaging data for research purposes. These images could provide a
      great wealth of information for researchers. METHODS: Patients from the Greater
      Toronto Area attending Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for imaging (magnetic
      resonance imagining, computed tomography, or ultrasound) examination areas were
      invited to participate in an electronic survey. RESULTS: Of the 1083 patients who
      were approached (computed tomography 609, ultrasound 314, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging 160), 798 (74%) agreed to take the survey. Overall median age was 60
      (interquartile range = 18, Q1 = 52, Q3 = 70), 52% were women, 42% had a
      university degree, and 7% had no high school diploma. In terms of willingness to 
      share de-identified medical images for research, 76% were willing (agreed and
      strongly agreed), while 7% refused. Most participants gave their family
      physicians (73%) and other physicians (57%) unconditional data access.
      Participants chose hospitals/research institutions to regulate electronic images 
      databases (70%), 89% wanted safeguards against unauthorized access to their data,
      and over 70% wanted control over who will be permitted, for how long, and the
      ability to revoke that permission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that people are
      willing to share their clinically acquired de-identified medical images for
      research studies provided that they have control over permissions and duration of
      access.

LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1471-6 [doi]
AB  - Modern network technology yields new interface for telecare medicine information 
      systems in short TMIS used for patient's healthcare. This system is used to
      provide healthcare services to patients at their home. It can be observed,
      telecare medicine information systems generally suffer several attacks as
      information being transmitted over a public network. Therefore, various
      authentication and key agreement schemes are proposed for TMIS to ensure secure
      and authorized patients communication over given public network. However, most of
      the schemes fail to achieve essential attributes discussed in this article.
      Although the key attributes of security and efficiency should be achieved in a
      common framework. This paper proposes construction of an RSA based authentication
      scheme for authorized access to healthcare services and achieves desirable key
      attributes of authentication protocols. Proof of security against polynomial time
      adversary is given in the random oracle to justify the security of proposed
      scheme. Communication analysis and computation analysis of proposed scheme
      indicates that proposed scheme's performance is comparable and having better
      security.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, inter-municipal cooperation in healthcare services
      has been an important measure implemented to meet future demographic changes in
      western countries. This entails an increased focus on communication and
      information sharing across organisational borders. Technology enables efficient
      and effective solutions to enhance such cooperation. However, the systems in the 
      healthcare sector tend not to communicate with one another. There is a lack of
      literature focusing on communication and information sharing in inter-municipal
      healthcare services. The aim of this article is to investigate both the
      characteristics of communication and information sharing, and the factors that
      serve as barriers to communication and information sharing for employees in
      inter-municipal healthcare services. METHODS: In this study, a qualitative case
      study approach is used to investigate both characteristics of communication and
      information sharing, and factors enabling barriers to communication and
      information sharing for employees in newly established inter-municipal healthcare
      services. Data collection methods were individual interviews, focus group
      interviews, observation studies and a workshop. A total of 18 persons
      participated in the study. The interviews, observations and workshop were
      conducted over a period of ten months. RESULTS: Communication and information
      sharing practices were found to be complex and characterised by multiple actors, 
      information types and a combination of multiple actions. Findings indicate that
      1. IT capability and usability 2. Differences 3. Privacy, confidentiality and
      security and 4. Awareness are all factors enabling barriers to communication and 
      information sharing in inter-municipal healthcare services. Specifically, these
      barriers were related to lack of EHR usability, inadequate workflow processes,
      digital systems incompatibility, the understanding of needs in different systems 
      and knowledge and practices regarding privacy and confidentiality. CONCLUSION: By
      focusing on the context of inter-municipal cooperation when assessing
      communication and information sharing in healthcare services, this article
      contributes to close a gap in existing knowledge. The perspective of the
      employees provides useful insight, and findings can be relevant for future theory
      development and for managers and policymakers in inter-municipal services.

TI  - Public Trust in Health Information Sharing: A Measure of System Trust.
PG  - 824-845
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.12654 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure public trust in a health information sharing in a broadly
      defined health system (system trust), inclusive of health care, public health,
      and research; to identify individual characteristics that predict system trust;
      and to consider these findings in the context of national health initiatives
      (e.g., learning health systems and precision medicine) that will expand the scope
      of data sharing. DATA SOURCES: Survey data (n = 1,011) were collected in February
      2014. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a composite index of four dimensions of system
      trust-competency, fidelity, integrity, and trustworthiness. The index was used in
      linear regression evaluating demographic and psychosocial predictors of system
      trust. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected by GfK Custom using a nationally
      representative sample and analyzed in Stata 13.0. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our
      findings suggest the public's trust may not meet the needs of health systems as
      they enter an era of expanded data sharing. We found that a majority of the U.S. 
      public does not trust the organizations that have health information and share it
      (i.e., the health system) in one or more dimensions. Together, demographic and
      psychosocial factors accounted for ~18 percent of the observed variability in
      system trust. Future research should consider additional predictors of system
      trust such as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs to inform policies and practices 
      for health data sharing.

TI  - Securing electronic medical record in Near Field Communication using Advanced
      Encryption Standard (AES).
PG  - 357-362
LID - 10.3233/THC-171140 [doi]
AB  - Doctors usually require patients' medical records before medical examinations.
      Nevertheless, obtaining such records may take time. Hence, Near Field
      Communication (NFC) could be used to store and send medical records between
      doctors and patients. Another issue is that there could be a threat such as, Man 
      In The Middle Attack and eavesdropping, thus, a security method is required to
      secure the data. Furthermore, the information regarding the key and
      initialisation vector in NFC cannot be sent using one data package, hence, the
      data transmission should be done several times. Therefore, the initialisation
      vector that changed in each transmission is implemented, and the key utilised is 
      based on the component agreed by both parties. This study aims at applying the
      cryptography process that does disturb and hinder the speed of data transmission.
      The result demonstrated that the data transmitted could be secured and the
      encryption process did not hinder data exchange. Also, different number of
      characters in plaintexts required different amount of time for encryption and
      decryption. It could be affected by the specifications of the devices used and
      the processes happening in the devices.

TI  - Achieving Efficient and Privacy-Preserving k-NN Query for Outsourced eHealthcare 
      Data.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1229-1 [doi]
AB  - The boom of Internet of Things devices promotes huge volumes of eHealthcare data 
      will be collected and aggregated at eHealthcare provider. With the help of these 
      health data, eHealthcare provider can offer reliable data service (e.g., k-NN
      query) to doctors for better diagnosis. However, the IT facility in the
      eHealthcare provider is incompetent with the huge volumes of eHealthcare data, so
      one popular solution is to deploy a powerful cloud and appoint the cloud to
      execute the k-NN query service. In this case, since the eHealthcare data are very
      sensitive yet cloud servers are not fully trusted, directly executing the k-NN
      query service in the cloud inevitably incurs privacy challenges. Apart from the
      privacy issues, efficiency issues also need to be taken into consideration
      because achieving privacy requirement will incur additional computational cost.
      However, existing focuses on k-NN query do not (fully) consider the data privacy 
      or are inefficient. For instance, the best computational complexity of k-NN query
      over encrypted eHealthcare data in the cloud is as large as [Formula: see text], 
      where N is the total number of data. In this paper, aiming at addressing the
      privacy and efficiency challenges, we design an efficient and privacy-preserving 
      k-NN query scheme for encrypted outsourced eHealthcare data. Our proposed scheme 
      is characterized by integrating the k d-tree with the homomorphic encryption
      technique for efficient storing encrypted data in the cloud and processing
      privacy-preserving k-NN query over encrypted data. Compared with existing works, 
      our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of privacy-preserving k-NN query. 
      Specifically, our proposed scheme can achieve k-NN computation over encrypted
      data with [Formula: see text] computational complexity, where l and N
      respectively denote the data dimension and the total number of data. In addition,
      detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is really
      privacy-preserving under our security model and performance evaluation also
      indicates that our proposed scheme is indeed efficient in terms of computational 
      cost.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Health Care Information Technologies: Evaluation of Trust,
      Security Beliefs, and Privacy as Determinants of Health Care Outcomes.
PG  - e107
LID - 10.2196/jmir.9014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diffusion of health information technologies (HITs) within the
      health care sector continues to grow. However, there is no theory explaining how 
      success of HITs influences patient care outcomes. With the increase in data
      breaches, HITs' success now hinges on the effectiveness of data protection
      solutions. Still, empirical research has only addressed privacy concerns, with
      little regard for other factors of information assurance. OBJECTIVE: The
      objective of this study was to study the effectiveness of HITs using the DeLone
      and McLean Information Systems Success Model (DMISSM). We examined the role of
      information assurance constructs (ie, the role of information security beliefs,
      privacy concerns, and trust in health information) as measures of HIT
      effectiveness. We also investigated the relationships between information
      assurance and three aspects of system success: attitude toward health information
      exchange (HIE), patient access to health records, and perceived patient care
      quality. METHODS: Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed the data from a
      sample of 3677 cancer patients from a public dataset. We used R software (R
      Project for Statistical Computing) and the Lavaan package to test the
      hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: Our extension of the DMISSM to health care
      was supported. We found that increased privacy concerns reduce the frequency of
      patient access to health records use, positive attitudes toward HIE, and
      perceptions of patient care quality. Also, belief in the effectiveness of
      information security increases the frequency of patient access to health records 
      and positive attitude toward HIE. Trust in health information had a positive
      association with attitudes toward HIE and perceived patient care quality. Trust
      in health information had no direct effect on patient access to health records;
      however, it had an indirect relationship through privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS:
      Trust in health information and belief in the effectiveness of information
      security safeguards increases perceptions of patient care quality. Privacy
      concerns reduce patients' frequency of accessing health records, patients'
      positive attitudes toward HIE exchange, and overall perceived patient care
      quality. Health care organizations are encouraged to implement security
      safeguards to increase trust, the frequency of health record use, and reduce
      privacy concerns, consequently increasing patient care quality.

TI  - Blockchain-Based Medical Records Secure Storage and Medical Service Framework.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1121-4 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and complete medical data are one valuable asset for patients. Privacy
      protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during
      medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records 
      has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain
      technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the
      characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain
      technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we
      design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and
      cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is
      described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are
      presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The
      proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no
      single party has absolute power to affect the processing.

TI  - Legal Barriers to the Growth of Health Information Exchange-Boulders or Pebbles?
PG  - 110-143
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12313 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points: Historically, in addition to economic and technical hurdles, state
      and federal health information privacy laws have been cited as a significant
      obstacle to expanding electronic health information exchange (HIE) in the United 
      States. Our review finds that over the past decade, several helpful developments 
      have ameliorated the legal barriers to HIE, although variation in states' patient
      consent requirements remains a challenge. Today, health care providers'
      complaints about legal obstacles to HIE may be better understood as reflecting
      concerns about the economic and competitive risks of information sharing.
      CONTEXT: Although the clinical benefits of exchanging patients' health
      information electronically across providers have long been recognized,
      participation in health information exchange (HIE) has lagged behind adoption of 
      electronic health records. Barriers erected by federal and state health
      information privacy law have been cited as a leading reason for the slow
      progress. A comprehensive assessment of these issues has not been undertaken for 
      nearly a decade, despite a number of salient legal developments. METHODS:
      Analysis of federal and state health information privacy statutes and regulations
      and secondary materials. FINDINGS: Although some legal barriers to HIE persist,
      many have been ameliorated-in some cases, simply through improved understanding
      of what the law actually requires. It is now clear that the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act presents no obstacles to electronically
      sharing protected health information for treatment purposes and does not hold
      providers who properly disclose information liable for privacy breaches by
      recipients. The failure of federal efforts to establish a unique patient
      identifier number does slow HIE by inhibiting optimal matching of patient
      records, but other action to facilitate matching will be taken under the 21st
      Century Cures Act. The Cures Act also creates the legal architecture to begin to 
      combat "information blocking." Varying patient consent requirements under federal
      and state law are the most important remaining legal barrier to HIE progress.
      However, federal rules relating to disclosure of substance-abuse treatment
      information were recently liberalized, and development of a technical standard,
      Data Segmentation for Privacy, or DS4P, now permits sensitive data requiring
      special handling to be segmented within a patient's record. Even with these
      developments, state-law requirements for patient consent remain daunting to
      navigate. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient consent requirements make HIE
      challenging, providers' expressed worries about legal barriers to participating
      in HIE likely primarily reflect concerns that are economically motivated.
      Lowering the cost of HIE or increasing financial incentives may boost provider
      participation more than further reducing legal barriers.

TI  - Balancing Health Information Exchange and Privacy Governance from a
      Patient-Centred Connected Health and Telehealth Perspective.
PG  - 48-54
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1641195 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Connected healthcare is an essential part of patient-centred care
      delivery. Technology such as telehealth is a critical part of connected
      healthcare. However, exchanging health information brings the risk of privacy
      issues. To better manage privacy risks we first need to understand the different 
      patterns of patient-centred care in order to tailor solutions to address privacy 
      risks. METHODS: Drawing upon published literature, we develop a business model to
      enable patient-centred care via telehealth. The model identifies three
      patient-centred connected health patterns. We then use the patterns to analyse
      potential privacy risks and possible solutions from different types of telehealth
      delivery. RESULTS: Connected healthcare raises the risk of unwarranted access to 
      health data and related invasion of privacy. However, the risk and extent of
      privacy issues differ according to the pattern of patient-centred care delivery
      and the type of particular challenge as they enable the highest degree of
      connectivity and thus the greatest potential for privacy breaches. CONCLUSION:
      Privacy issues are a major concern in telehealth systems and patients, providers,
      and administrators need to be aware of these privacy issues and have guidance on 
      how to manage them. This paper integrates patient-centred connected health care, 
      telehealth, and privacy risks to provide an understanding of how risks vary
      across different patterns of patient-centred connected health and different types
      of telehealth delivery.

TI  - Anonymity Preserving and Lightweight Multimedical Server Authentication Protocol 
      for Telecare Medical Information System.
PG  - 1749-1759
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2870319 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health systems, such as telecare medical information system (TMIS),
      allow patients to exchange their health information with a medical center/doctor 
      for diagnosis in real time, and across borders. Given the sensitive nature of
      health information/medical data, ensuring the security of such systems is
      crucial. In this paper, we revisit Das et al.'s authentication protocol, which is
      designed to ensure patient anonymity and untraceability. Then, we demonstrate
      that the security claims are invalid, by showing how both security features
      (i.e., patient anonymity and untraceability) can be compromised. We also
      demonstrate that the protocol suffers from smartcard launch attacks. To mitigate 
      such design flaws, we propose a new lightweight authentication protocol using the
      cryptographic hash function for TMIS. We then analyze the security of the
      proposed protocol using AVISPA and Scyther, two widely used formal specification 
      tools. The performance analysis demonstrates that our protocol is more efficient 
      than other competing protocols.

TI  - Sharing ICU Patient Data Responsibly Under the Society of Critical Care
      Medicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Joint Data Science
      Collaboration: The Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database (AmsterdamUMCdb)
      Example.
PG  - e563-e577
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004916 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Critical care medicine is a natural environment for machine learning 
      approaches to improve outcomes for critically ill patients as admissions to ICUs 
      generate vast amounts of data. However, technical, legal, ethical, and privacy
      concerns have so far limited the critical care medicine community from making
      these data readily available. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the
      European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have identified ICU patient data
      sharing as one of the priorities under their Joint Data Science Collaboration. To
      encourage ICUs worldwide to share their patient data responsibly, we now describe
      the development and release of Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database
      (AmsterdamUMCdb), the first freely available critical care database in full
      compliance with privacy laws from both the United States and Europe, as an
      example of the feasibility of sharing complex critical care data. SETTING:
      University hospital ICU. SUBJECTS: Data from ICU patients admitted between 2003
      and 2016. INTERVENTIONS: We used a risk-based deidentification strategy to
      maintain data utility while preserving privacy. In addition, we implemented
      contractual and governance processes, and a communication strategy. Patient
      organizations, supporting hospitals, and experts on ethics and privacy audited
      these processes and the database. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: AmsterdamUMCdb
      contains approximately 1 billion clinical data points from 23,106 admissions of
      20,109 patients. The privacy audit concluded that reidentification is not
      reasonably likely, and AmsterdamUMCdb can therefore be considered as anonymous
      information, both in the context of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation. The
      ethics audit concluded that responsible data sharing imposes minimal burden,
      whereas the potential benefit is tremendous. CONCLUSIONS: Technical, legal,
      ethical, and privacy challenges related to responsible data sharing can be
      addressed using a multidisciplinary approach. A risk-based deidentification
      strategy, that complies with both U.S. and European privacy regulations, should
      be the preferred approach to releasing ICU patient data. This supports the shared
      Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine
      vision to improve critical care outcomes through scientific inquiry of vast and
      combined ICU datasets.

TI  - Design of a Secure Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for Smart Healthcare.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1251-3 [doi]
AB  - Now-a-days, the society is witnessing a keen urge to enhance the quality of
      healthcare services with the intervention of technology in the health sector. The
      main focus in transforming traditional healthcare to smart healthcare is on
      facilitating the patients as well as medical professionals. However, this
      changover is not easy due to various issues of security and integrity associated 
      with it. Security of patients's personal health record and privacy can be handled
      well by permitting only authorized access to the confidential health-data via
      suitably designed authentication scheme. In pursuit to contribute in this
      direction, we came across the role of Universal Serial Bus (USB), the most widely
      accepted interface, in enabling communication between peripheral devices and a
      host controller like laptop, personal computer, smart phone, tablet etc. In the
      process, we analysed a recently proposed a three-factor authentication scheme for
      consumer USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD) by He et al. In this paper, we
      demonstrate that He et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to leakage of temporary but
      session specific information attacks, late detection of message replay, forward
      secrecy attacks, and backward secrecy attacks. Then motivated with the benefits
      of USB, we propose a secure three-factor authentication scheme for smart
      healthcare.

AB  - Because extensive data from medical records are gathered by organ procurement
      teams, the process of data transfer between sites created a data security risk.
      This includes the use of fax machines, courier services, and employees' vehicles.
      Even health records transmitted over public Wi-Fi become at risk for a data
      breach. The Plan-Do-Study-Act method for performance improvement was used to
      address this time-consuming and labor-intensive process. A secured virtual
      private network from within the donor hospital site setting was developed to
      improve the transfer of images and data. The goal was to improve the process and 
      increase data security. Once the new network was in place, the process steps
      decreased and eliminated data vulnerability. Average process time decreased by
      approximately 1 hour. Organs procured increased from pre (expected 3, observed 2)
      to post (expected 3, observed 5) implementation of the new process.

TI  - Facilitating Cancer Epidemiologic Efforts in Cleveland via Creation of
      Longitudinal De-Duplicated Patient Data Sets.
PG  - 787-795
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cleveland, Ohio, is home to three major hospital systems serving
      approximately 80% of the Northeast Ohio population. The Cleveland Clinic,
      University Hospitals Health System, and MetroHealth are direct competitors for
      primary and specialty care, and patient overlap between these systems is high.
      Fragmentation of health data that exist in silos at these health systems produces
      an overestimation of disease burden due to double and sometimes triple counting
      of patients. As a result, longitudinal population-based studies across the
      Cleveland patient population are impeded unless accurate and actionable
      clinically derived health data sets can be created. METHODS: The Cleveland
      Institute for Computational Biology has developed the De-Duplicate and
      De-Identify Research Engine (DeDeRE) that, without any exchange of personal
      health identifiers (PHI) between health systems, will effectively de-duplicate
      the patients between one or more health entities. RESULTS: The immediate utility 
      of this software for cancer epidemiology is the increased accuracy in measuring
      cancer burden and the potential to perform longitudinal studies with
      de-duplicated, de-identified data sets. CONCLUSIONS: The DeDeRE software
      developed and tested here accomplishes its goals without exposing PHIs using a
      state-of-the-art, trusted privacy preservation network enabled by a hash-based
      matching algorithm. IMPACT: This paper will guide the reader through the
      functions currently developed in DeDeRE and how a healthcare organization (HCO)
      employing the release version of this technology can begin sharing data with one 
      or more additional HCOs in a collaborative and noncompetitive manner to create a 
      regional population health resource for cancer researchers.See all articles in

      Information Exchanges (HIEs) by Healthcare Entities.
PG  - 1202-1211
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2018.1471336 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) by healthcare
      organizations may not achieve the desired outcomes as consumers may request that 
      their health information remains unshared because of information privacy
      concerns. Drawing on the insights of concern for information privacy (CFIP)
      literature, this work extends the application of CFIP to the HIE domain. This
      study attempts to develop and test a model centered on the four dimensions of
      CFIP construct (collection, errors, unauthorized access, and secondary use) and
      their antecedents to predict consumers' opt-in behavioral intention toward HIE in
      the presence of the perceived health status' effects. We conducted an online
      survey in the United States using 826 samples. The results demonstrate that the
      perceived health information sensitivity and computer anxiety meaningfully
      contribute to information privacy concerns and CFIP construct significantly
      impedes consumers' opt-in decision to HIEs. Interestingly, contrary to our
      expectation, perceived poor health status considerably attenuates the negative
      effects exerted by CFIP on opt-in intention. The model proposed by this study can
      be used as a useful conceptual tool by both further studies and practitioners to 
      examine the complex nature of patients' reactions to information privacy threats 
      associated with the use of HIE technology in the healthcare industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) enables
      physicians to efficiently and conveniently make certain diagnoses and medical
      treatment for patients over the insecure public Internet. To ensure patients
      securely access to medicinal services, many authentication schemes have been
      proposed. Although numerous cryptographic authentication schemes for TMIS have
      been proposed with the aim to ensure data security, user privacy and
      authentication, various forms of attacks make these schemes impractical. METHODS:
      To design a truly secure and practical authentication scheme for TMIS, a new
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS
      without sharing the system private key with distributed servers is presented in
      this work. RESULTS: Our proposed protocol has perfect security features including
      mutual authentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and resisting
      various well-known attacks, and these security feathers are confirmed by the BAN 
      logic and heuristic cryptanalysis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A secure
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS is
      presented in this work, which has perfect security properties including perfect
      forward secrecy, supporting user anonymity, etc., and can withstand various
      attacks such as impersonation attack, off-line password guessing attack, etc..
      Considering security is the most important factor for an authentication scheme,
      so our scheme is more suitable for multi-server TMIS.
