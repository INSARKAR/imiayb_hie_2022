TI  - How Does Electronic Health Information Exchange Affect Hospital Performance
      Efficiency? The Effects of Breadth and Depth of Information Sharing.
PG  - 212-228
LID - 10.1097/JHM-D-16-00041 [doi]
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This research was motivated by the large investment in health 
      information technology (IT) by hospitals and the inconsistent findings related to
      the effects of health IT adoption on hospital performance. Building on resource
      orchestration theory and the information systems literature, the authors
      developed a research model to investigate how the configuration strategies for
      sharing information under health IT systems affect hospital efficiency. The
      hypotheses were tested using data from the 2010 annual and IT surveys of the
      American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services case mix 
      index, and U.S. Census Bureau's small-area income and poverty estimates. The
      study revealed that in health IT systems, the breadth (extent) and depth (level
      of detail) of digital information sharing among stakeholders each has a
      curvilinear relationship with hospital efficiency. In addition, breadth and depth
      reinforce each other's positive effects and attenuate each other's negative
      effects, and their balance has a positive effect on hospital efficiency. The
      results of this research have the potential to enrich the literature on the value
      of adopting health IT systems as well as in providing practitioner guidelines for
      meaningful use.

TI  - Does participation in health information exchange improve hospital efficiency?
PG  - 426-438
LID - 10.1007/s10729-017-9396-4 [doi]
AB  - The federal government allocated nearly $30 billion to spur the development of
      information technology infrastructure capable of supporting the exchange of
      interoperable clinical data, leading to growth in hospital participation in
      health information exchange (HIE) networks. HIEs have the potential to improve
      care coordination across healthcare providers, leading ultimately to increased
      productivity of health services for hospitals. However, the impact of HIE
      participation on hospital efficiency remains unclear. This dynamic prompts the
      question asked by this study: does HIE participation improve hospital efficiency.
      This study estimates the effect of HIE participation on efficiency using a
      national sample of 1017 hospitals from 2009 to 2012. Using a two-stage analytic
      design, efficiency indices were determined using the Malmquist algorithm and then
      regressed on a set of hospital characteristics. Results suggest that any
      participation in HIE can improve both technical efficiency change and total
      factor productivity (TFP). A second model examining total years of HIE
      participation shows a benefit of one and three years of participation on TFP.
      These results suggest that hospital investment in HIE participation may be a
      useful strategy to improve hospital operational performance, and that policy
      should continue to support increased participation and use of HIE. More research 
      is needed to identify the exact mechanisms through which HIE participation can
      improve hospital efficiency.

TI  - Trends in user-initiated health information exchange in the inpatient,
      outpatient, and emergency settings.
PG  - 622-627
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa226 [doi]
AB  - Prior research on health information exchange (HIE) typically measured provider
      usage through surveys or they summarized the availability of HIE services in a
      healthcare organization. Few studies utilized user log files. Using HIE access
      log files, we measured HIE use in real-world clinical settings over a 7-year
      period (2011-2017). Use of HIE increased in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency 
      department (ED) settings. Further, while extant literature has generally viewed
      the ED as the most relevant setting for HIE, the greatest change in HIE use was
      observed in the inpatient setting, followed by the ED setting and then the
      outpatient setting. Our findings suggest that in addition to federal incentives, 
      the implementation of features that address barriers to access (eg, Single Sign
      On), as well as value-added services (eg, interoperability with external data
      sources), may be related to the growth in user-initiated HIE.

TI  - Health systems' use of enterprise health information exchange vs single
      electronic health record vendor environments and unplanned readmissions.
PG  - 989-998
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz116 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enterprise health information exchange (HIE) and a single electronic
      health record (EHR) vendor solution are 2 information exchange approaches to
      improve performance and increase the quality of care. This study sought to
      determine the association between adoption of enterprise HIE vs a single vendor
      environment and changes in unplanned readmissions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      association between unplanned 30-day readmissions among adult patients and
      adoption of enterprise HIE or a single vendor environment was measured in a panel
      of 211 system-member hospitals from 2010 through 2014 using fixed-effects
      regression models. Sample hospitals were members of health systems in 7 states.
      Enterprise HIE was defined as self-reported ability to exchange information with 
      other members of the same health system who used different EHR vendors. A single 
      EHR vendor environment reported exchanging information with other health system
      members, but all using the same EHR vendor. RESULTS: Enterprise HIE adoption was 
      more common among the study sample than EHR (75% vs 24%). However, adoption of a 
      single EHR vendor environment was associated with a 0.8% reduction in the
      probability of a readmission within 30 days of discharge. The estimated impact of
      adopting an enterprise HIE strategy on readmissions was smaller and not
      statically significant. CONCLUSION: Reductions in the probability of an unplanned
      readmission after a hospital adopts a single vendor environment suggests that HIE
      technologies can better support the aim of higher quality care. Additionally,
      health systems may benefit more from a single vendor environment approach than
      attempting to foster exchange across multiple EHR vendors.

AB  - This study explores factors associated with the breadth (extent) and depth (level
      of detail) of digital information exchange among stakeholders in health
      information technology (IT) systems. Annual and IT surveys of the American
      Hospital Association and the U.S. Census Bureau's small-area income and poverty
      estimates from 2014-2016 were analyzed for associations between key factors and
      breadth and depth of information exchange. OLS Regression was used with a sample 
      consisting of 10,040 year-hospital observations. We found that hospital-level
      variables such as size, ownership type, system affiliation, physician-hospital
      arrangement, and revenue model affect information exchange. We further found that
      market-level variables such as concentration ratio, urbanness, and median
      household income, although they directly affect information exchange, do not
      moderate the relationship between hospital-level variables and information
      exchange. Our study fills a gap in the previous literature arising from the lack 
      of research on the determinants of health information exchange.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study seeks to understand the key inhibitors for health information
      exchange (HIE) by ambulatory (outpatient) clinics. We examine the key
      technological, organizational and environmental factors that inhibit an
      ambulatory clinic from electronically exchanging health information with external
      clinics and hospitals. METHODS: We utilize survey data from 1285 ambulatory
      clinics in the US state of Minnesota. Using logistic regressions, we assess if
      the ambulatory clinic's HIE with external clinics and external hospitals are
      associated with fourteen inhibitors from technological, organizational and
      environmental contexts in which ambulatory clinics operate. RESULTS: Among the
      technological inhibitors, we find lack of adequate technological infrastructure, 
      difficulties in integrating external data with electronic medical record systems,
      and security concerns to inhibit ambulatory clinics' HIE with both clinics and
      hospitals. Inadequate technical support was a barrier for HIE with hospitals,
      whereas inadequate training of staff was an inhibitor for clinic-to-clinic HIE.
      Of the environmental variables, legal concerns and complexity in framing HIE
      agreements with partners were found to inhibit ambulatory clinics' HIE with both 
      external clinics and hospitals. Lack of partner readiness and ability was an
      inhibiting factor for clinic-to-hospital HIE whereas issues in patient consent,
      and problems in choosing the right vendor with a good fit were inhibiting
      ambulatory clinics' HIE with other clinics. Among the organizational variables,
      lack of adequate senior leadership support and complexity of workflow changes
      inhibited clinic-to-clinic health data sharing, whereas unclear return on
      investment (ROI) for HIE was a deterrent for ambulatory clinics' HIE with
      hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: This study throws light on electronic HIE practices and
      its key inhibitors in ambulatory clinics, an understudied area in digital health.
      This paper provides unique insights into specific inhibitors that deter
      clinic-to-clinic health information sharing versus those that affect and
      clinic-to-hospital health information exchange.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the level of health information exchange (HIE) in
      U.S. hospitals is related to technology capabilities, incentives to exchange, or 
      both. STUDY SETTING: A total of 1,812 hospitals attesting to stage 2 of
      Medicare's Meaningful Use Incentive Program through April 2016. STUDY DESIGN:
      Hospital-level, multivariate OLS regression with state fixed effects was used to 
      analyze the relationship between technology capability and incentives measures,
      and percent of care transitions with summary of care records (SCRs) sent
      electronically to subsequent providers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stage 2 hospitals
      reported sending SCRs electronically for an average of 41 percent (median = 33
      percent) of transitions. HIE level is related to four capability measures, one
      incentive measure, and one measure that is related to both capability and
      incentive. Percent of transitions with SCRs sent electronically was 3 percentage 
      points higher (95 percent CI: 0.1-5.1) for hospitals with a third-party HIE
      vendor, 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 0.5-5.4) for hospitals with an
      EHR vendor as their HIE vendor, and 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      0.4-5.4) for hospitals that automatically alert primary care providers. The
      direction and statistical significance of the relationships between specific EHR 
      vendor and electronic SCR transmission level varied by vendor. Nonprofits and
      government hospitals performed 5 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      1.5-9.1) and 8 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 3.4-12.3) than
      for-profits. Hospitals in systems performed 3 percentage points higher (95
      percent CI: 0.8-6.1). CONCLUSION: The overall level of HIE is low, with hospitals
      sending an SCR electronically for less than half of patient transitions. Specific
      hospital characteristics related to both technology capabilities and incentives
      were associated with higher levels of HIE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE) systems are computer tools that
      healthcare providers use to share patients' medical information electronically.
      Our study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by general
      practitioners (GPs) when using an HIE system in the Canton of Ticino, a region in
      southern Switzerland. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using
      semi-structured interviews. Ten GPs participated in the study. We analysed
      transcripts using thematic content analysis and following an abductive approach
      (a mix of deductive and inductive approaches). RESULTS: Our findings indicate the
      following main facilitators of the HIE system: (a) the perception of having to do
      with a secure system; (b) the possibility of delegating its management to
      secretaries and healthcare assistants; (c) technical support and training; (d)
      high quality of the information exchanged; (e) positive impact on clinical
      practice; and (f) regional context. However, major challenges still persist, and 
      GPs reported the following main barriers to using an HIE system: (a) a frequent
      lack of all the patient documentation they needed; (b) no effective workflow
      improvements; and (c) lack of some technical features. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      of our study provide a qualitative perspective of opinions and experiences of GPs
      that can inform improvements of the current HIE system and future federal and
      cantonal HIE initiatives in Switzerland and elsewhere.

AB  - Despite patient safety initiatives to improve care transitions, prior research
      largely neglects to elicit feedback from home health nurses regarding health
      information exchange. The goal of this quality improvement study was to identify 
      opportunities to facilitate information transfer during
      hospital-to-home-health-care transitions for older adults with heart failure. We 
      conducted focus groups with 19 nurses employed by a single healthcare system
      using two commercially available electronic health record (EHR) vendors. We
      analyzed interview transcripts following an immersion/crystallization approach to
      identify themes. Average participants were females in their mid-fifties with 15
      years of home health experience. Nurses reported challenges with
      hospital-to-home-health-care information exchange, specifically: 1) poor
      medication management, 2) ineffective communication, 3) technology issues, and 4)
      patient factors. Nurses identified several opportunities for improvement,
      including discordant EHR-generated medication lists, which may be amenable to
      technological solutions. Local quality improvement efforts should incorporate
      nurses' suggestions and leverage existing best practices.

TI  - Impact of the 2015 Health Information Technology Certification Edition on
      Interoperability among Hospitals.
PG  - 1866-1873
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab083 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most nonfederal acute care hospitals use electronic health records
      (EHRs) certified by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
      Technology. In 2015, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health
      Information Technology finalized the 2015 Health IT Certification Edition and
      adoption by hospitals began in 2016. We examine the impact of the 2015 Edition on
      rates of interoperable exchange among nonfederal acute hospitals. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The study applies a standard difference-in-differences design and a
      recently developed fixed effects estimator that relaxes the assumption of
      treatment effects being constant across groups and time. In the analysis, we
      identify separate effects of the 2015 Edition for hospitals that switched EHR
      developers and forecast hospitals' interoperability over 2015 Edition adoption
      rates. RESULTS: The adoption of the 2015 Edition increased hospitals' rates of
      interoperable exchange and especially benefited hospitals that switched EHR
      developers in the post-implementation period. Forecasting results indicate that
      if all hospitals adopted the 2015 Edition, 53% to 61% of hospitals would engage
      in interoperable health information exchange compared with the current rate of
      46%. DISCUSSION: Hospitals' levels of interoperability have been rising over the 
      last few years. Adoption of newer technology improved hospitals' interoperability
      and accounts for up to 12% of the rise in interoperability. CONCLUSIONS:
      Certified technology is one mechanism to ensure providers use recent and safe
      technologies for interoperable exchange. Adoption of certified EHRs improves the 
      nation's interoperable exchange; however, it has a clear limited effect. Other
      mechanisms are necessary for achieving comprehensive interoperable exchange.

TI  - Advancing laboratory medicine in hospitals through health information exchange: a
      survey of specialist physicians in Canada.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/s12911-020-1061-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing occupies a prominent place in health care.
      Information technology systems have the potential to empower laboratory experts
      and to enhance the interpretation of test results in order to better support
      physicians in their quest for better and safer patient care. This study sought to
      develop a better understanding of which laboratory information exchange (LIE)
      systems and features specialist physicians are using in hospital settings to
      consult their patients' laboratory test results, and what benefit they derive
      from such use. METHODS: As part of a broader research program on the use of
      health information exchange systems for laboratory medicine in Quebec, Canada,
      this study was designed as on online survey. Our sample is composed of 566
      specialist physicians working in hospital settings, out of the 1512 physicians
      who responded to the survey (response rate of 17%). Respondents are
      representative of the targeted population of specialist physicians in terms of
      gender, age and hospital location. RESULTS: We first observed that 80% of the
      surveyed physicians used the province-wide interoperable electronic health
      records (iEHR) system and 93% used a laboratory results viewer (LRV) to consult
      laboratory test results and most (72%) use both systems to retrieve lab results. 
      Next, our findings reveal important differences in the capabilities available in 
      each type of system and in the use of these capabilities. Third, there are
      differences in the nature of the perceived benefits obtained from the use of each
      of these two systems. Last, the extent of use of an LRV is strongly influenced by
      the IT artefact itself (i.e., the hospital's LRV available capabilities) while
      the use of the provincial iEHR system is influenced by its organizational context
      (i.e. the hospital's size and location). CONCLUSIONS: The main contribution of
      this study lies in its insights into the role played by context in shaping
      physicians' choices about which laboratory information exchange systems to adopt 
      and which features to use, and the different perceptions they have about benefits
      arising from such use. One related implication for practice is that success of
      LIE initiatives should not be solely assessed with basic usage statistics.

TI  - A strategic gaming model for health information exchange markets.
PG  - 119-130
LID - 10.1007/s10729-016-9382-2 [doi]
AB  - Current market conditions create incentives for some providers to exercise
      control over patient data in ways that unreasonably limit its availability and
      use. Here we develop a game theoretic model for estimating the willingness of
      healthcare organizations to join a health information exchange (HIE) network and 
      demonstrate its use in HIE policy design. We formulated the model as a bi-level
      integer program. A quasi-Newton method is proposed to obtain a strategy Nash
      equilibrium. We applied our modeling and solution technique to 1,093,177
      encounters for exchanging information over a 7.5-year period in 9 hospitals
      located within a three-county region in Florida. Under a set of assumptions, we
      found that a proposed federal penalty of up to $2,000,000 has a higher impact on 
      increasing HIE adoption than current federal monetary incentives. Medium-sized
      hospitals were more reticent to adopt HIE than large-sized hospitals. In the
      presence of collusion among multiple hospitals to not adopt HIE, neither federal 
      incentives nor proposed penalties increase hospitals' willingness to adopt.
      Hospitals' apathy toward HIE adoption may threaten the value of
      inter-connectivity even with federal incentives in place. Competition among
      hospitals, coupled with volume-based payment systems, creates no incentives for
      smaller hospitals to exchange data with competitors. Medium-sized hospitals need 
      targeted actions (e.g., outside technological assistance, group purchasing
      arrangements) to mitigate market incentives to not adopt HIE. Strategic game
      theoretic models help to clarify HIE adoption decisions under market conditions
      at play in an extremely complex technology environment.

AB  - In this article, we ponder multi-user medical image transmission using Cognitive 
      Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) Multi-carrier Code-division-multiple-access
      (MC-CDMA) system to monitor patient information. We investigate the performance
      of such system in the communication layer and application layer of internet of
      things (IOT). Patient monitoring system plays vital role in the hospital
      particularly in the emergency ward to resolve certain problems such as
      maintaining glucose level in the body, maintaining minimum sugar levels under
      emergency conditions. IOT find tremendous application in the hospital to deal
      with certain issues such as injection of drug to the patients by doctor from
      remote places, monitoring patients heart beats, sugar level by the concerned
      doctors. MIMO finds many applications in medical field to enrich data rate while 
      communication patient information at faster rate. We utilize MC-CDMA system to
      accommodate large user patients information and to transmit such information with
      high resolution by eliminating channel impairments. We are utilizing Cognitive
      spectrum for medical image transmission of higher bandwidth applications. We
      realize Double-space-time transmit diversity as MIMO profile to boost up
      throughput. We perform multi-carrier modulation using IDFT at the transmitter .we
      carryout demodulation employing DFT at the hospital. We introduce Multi-carrier
      communication to fulfil the need of bandwidth efficiency and to diminish
      frequency selectivity effects.In the application layer, we estimate patient's
      information with aid of block-nulling decoding algorithm. Moreover we analyze the
      quality of image of D-STTD MC-CDMA system with turbo style of channel encoder to 
      manifest medical image with high resolution with less signal strength. We
      conclude that Cognitive D-STTD MC-CDMA system provides reliable communication for
      the application of IOT and also transfer high resolution medical image with less 
      signal strength in order to observe patient status by doctor.

TI  - Does Health Information Exchange Improve Patient Outcomes? Empirical Evidence
      From Florida Hospitals.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05447 [doi]
AB  - Achieving widespread exchange of health information is a national health policy
      objective, for it is believed to boost treatment efficiency, reduce health care
      costs, and improve patient outcomes. We used state-level data for 2011-14 from
      Florida to examine the relationship between hospitals' participation in health
      information exchange (HIE) and quality and health outcomes. HIE participation was
      associated with a decrease in the probability of unplanned, thirty-day
      readmissions for acute myocardial infarction that was 1.3 percentage points
      greater than that seen at nonparticipating hospitals. This decrease was driven
      primarily by reduced readmissions to hospitals other than those that provided
      initial inpatient treatment. These findings indicate that HIE can be leveraged to
      improve quality measures targeted by the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program 
      and may hold promise for achieving broader policy goals.

TI  - Gaps in health information exchange between hospitals that treat many shared
      patients.
PG  - 1114-1121
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy089 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hospitals that routinely share patients are those that most critically
      need to engage in electronic health information exchange (HIE) with each other to
      ensure clinical information is available to inform treatment decisions. We
      surveyed pairs of hospitals in a nationwide sample to describe whether and how
      hospitals within each hospital referral region (HRR) that have the highest shared
      patient (HSP) volume engaged in HIE with each other. Methods: We used Medicare's 
      Physician Shared Patient Patterns data to identify hospital pairs with the
      highest shared patient volume in each hospital referral region. We surveyed a
      purposeful sample of pairs and then calculated descriptive statistics to compare:
      (1) HIE with the HSP hospital vs HIE with other hospitals, and (2) HIE with the
      HSP hospital versus federal measures of HIE engagement that are not
      partner-specific. Results: We received responses from 25.5% of contacted
      hospitals and 33.5% of contacted pairs, allowing us to examine information
      sharing among 68 hospitals in 63 pairs. 23% of respondents reported worse
      information sharing with their HSP hospital than with other hospitals while 17%
      indicated better sharing with their HSP hospital and 48% indicated no difference.
      Our HSP-specific measures of HIE differed from federal measures of HIE
      engagement: while 97% of respondents are classified as routinely sending
      information electronically in federal measures, in our data only 63% did so with 
      their HSP hospital. Conclusions: Despite increased HIE engagement, our
      descriptive results indicate that HIE is not developing in a way that facilitates
      information exchange where it might benefit the most patients. New policy
      efforts, particularly those emerging from the 21st Century Cures Act, need to
      explicitly pursue strategies that ensure that HSP providers engage in exchange
      with each other.

      increased sharing of patients.
PG  - 128-135
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13240 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One potential benefit of greater electronic health information
      exchange is a reduction in the effort required for patients to switch between
      providers. We therefore assessed whether hospital participation in health
      information organizations (HIOs) led to increased patient sharing. DATA SOURCES: 
      Secondary data from 2010 to 2016. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital-pair and year
      fixed effects regression models, we assessed change in patient sharing volume
      following HIO participation by hospitals and compared the effect by the level of 
      market competition and by hospital size. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: We used
      national data on hospital participation in HIOs from the American Hospital
      Association Information Technology Supplement and data on the volume of Medicare 
      patients shared between pairs of hospitals from 2010 to 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      The volume of patients shared between hospitals increased by 2.6 percent when
      both hospitals participated in a health information organization (P = .008, 95%
      CI: 0.7%-4.5%). This increase was greater in competitive markets (3.1 percent
      increase, P = .03 95% CI: 0.3%-5.9%) and between large hospitals (4.3 percent
      increase, P = .007 95% CI: 1.2%-7.3%). Participation by only one hospital in a
      pair had no effect on patient sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an
      important policy goal motivating the investment in health information exchange
      has been at least partially achieved. However, our results also support hospital 
      concerns about the competitive implications of engaging in health information
      exchange. HIO participation appears to facilitate patient movement between
      hospitals, likely by lowering switching costs and resulting in greater
      competition.

TI  - Alternative payment models and hospital engagement in health information
      exchange.
PG  - e1-e6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether hospital participation in alternative payment
      models (APMs) is associated with greater engagement in health information
      exchange (HIE) along 4 dimensions: volume of patients for whom information is
      exchanged, diversity of information types, breadth of partner types, and depth of
      technical approach. STUDY DESIGN: Pooled, cross-sectional analysis of data on US 
      hospitals from 2014 to 2015. METHODS: APM participation came from Leavitt
      Partners data, Medicare public use files, and the American Hospital Association
      (AHA) Annual Survey. We used Medicare data to measure HIE volume for 798
      hospitals attesting to stage 2 Meaningful Use and the AHA Information Technology 
      Supplement to measure HIE diversity, breadth, and depth for 1730 hospitals. We
      used mixed-effects regression to estimate the association between participation
      in APMs and each dimension of HIE. RESULTS: Compared with nonparticipating
      hospitals, full-year APM participation was associated with lower HIE volume (data
      were sent for 11 percentage points fewer discharges; P = .003), greater HIE
      diversity (of 4 data types, 0.3 more were transmitted; P <.001), greater HIE
      breadth (of 3 partner types, data were sent to 0.3 more; P <.001), and greater
      HIE depth (the odds of using a push and pull approach were 1.68 times greater; P 
      = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that APM participation was associated with
      greater HIE diversity, breadth, and depth suggests that value-based payment may
      be spurring improvements in HIE infrastructure. However, our finding that APM
      participation is associated with lower HIE volume suggests that there may be an
      incentive to focus HIE investments on a limited number of partners.

TI  - The relationship between hospital and ehr vendor market dynamics on health
      information organization presence and participation.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0605-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health Information Organizations (HIOs) are third party organizations
      that facilitate electronic health information exchange (HIE) between providers in
      a geographic area. Despite benefits from HIE, HIOs have struggled to form and
      subsequently gain broad provider participation. We sought to assess whether
      market-level hospital and EHR vendor dynamics are associated with presence and
      level of hospital participation in HIOs. METHODS: 2014 data on 4523 hospitals and
      their EHR vendors were aggregated to the market level. We used multivariate OLS
      regression to analyze the relationship between hospital and vendor dynamics and
      (1) probability of HIO presence and (2) percent of hospitals participating in an 
      HIO. RESULTS: 298 of 469 markets (64%) had HIO presence, and in those markets,
      47% of hospitals participated in an HIO on average. In multivariate analysis,
      four characteristics were associated with HIO presence. Markets with more
      hospitals, markets with more EHR vendors, and markets with an EHR vendor-led HIE 
      approach were more likely to have an HIO. Compared to markets with low hospital
      competition, markets with high hospital competition had a 25 percentage point
      lower probability of HIO presence. Two characteristics were associated with level
      of hospital HIO participation. Markets with more hospitals as well as markets
      with high vendor competition (compared to low competition) had lower
      participation. CONCLUSION: Both hospital and EHR vendor dynamics are associated
      with whether a market has an HIO as well as the level of hospital participation
      in HIOs.

TI  - Electronic Health Information Exchange At Discharge From Inpatient Psychiatric
      Care In Acute Care Hospitals.
PG  - 958-967
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00985 [doi]
AB  - To address the complex health care needs of patients with mental illness-who
      commonly have co-occurring medical conditions and substance use disorders-it is
      critically important for providers to use electronic health records (EHRs) for
      health information exchange (HIE) when patients are transferred from inpatient
      psychiatric units in acute care hospitals. Efficient and timely HIE is necessary 
      to ensure that patients receive adequate and informed follow-up care. This study 
      examined the percentage of inpatient psychiatric units that reported using EHRs
      for HIE at transfers of care and hospital characteristics associated with that
      use. We linked national data from the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality
      Reporting Program of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the American
      Hospital Association Annual Survey, and state mental health privacy laws. In 2016
      the use of electronic HIE upon transfer from psychiatric units lagged behind the 
      corresponding overall use rates from acute care hospitals (56.3 percent versus 88
      percent), with wide variation across states. Hospital size and accountable care
      organization participation were associated with electronic HIE, but a state's
      having mental health privacy laws more stringent than the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act did not. Given these results, policy efforts
      to incentivize the use of electronic HIE in psychiatric settings should be
      strengthened.

PG  - 981-993
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13169 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of two approaches (directed and query-based) to
      health information exchange (HIE) on potentially avoidable use of health care
      services. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data on ambulatory care providers' adoption
      of HIE were merged with Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2008 to 2014.
      Providers were from 13 counties in New York served by the Rochester Regional
      Health Information Organization (RHIO). STUDY DESIGN: Linear regression models
      with provider and year fixed effects were used to estimate changes in the
      probability of utilization outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to
      providers adopting directed and/or query-based HIE compared with beneficiaries
      attributed to providers who had not adopted HIE. DATA COLLECTION: Providers' HIE 
      adoption status was determined through Rochester RHIO registration records. RHIO 
      and claims data were linked via National Provider Identifiers. PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Query-based HIE adoption was associated with a 0.2 percentage point
      reduction in the probability of an ambulatory care sensitive hospitalization and 
      a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of an unplanned readmission.
      Directed HIE adoption was not associated with any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) EHR certification criteria
      includes requirements for directed HIE, but not query-based HIE. Pending further 
      research, certification criteria should place equal weight on facilitating
      query-based and directed exchange.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Birth defects surveillance in the United States is conducted
      principally by review of routine but lagged reporting to statewide congenital
      malformations registries of diagnoses by hospitals or other health care
      providers, a process that is not designed to rapidly detect changes in
      prevalence. Health information exchange (HIE) systems are well suited for rapid
      surveillance, but information is limited about their effectiveness at detecting
      birth defects. We evaluated HIE data to detect microcephaly diagnosed at birth
      during January 1, 2013-December 31, 2015 before known introduction of Zika virus 
      in North America. METHODS: Data from an HIE system were queried for microcephaly 
      diagnostic codes on day of birth or during the first two days after birth at
      three Bronx hospitals for births to New York City resident mothers. Suspected
      cases identified by HIE data were compared with microcephaly cases that had been 
      identified through direct inquiry of hospital records and confirmed by chart
      abstraction in a previous study of the same cohort. RESULTS: Of 16,910 live
      births, 43 suspected microcephaly cases were identified through an HIE system
      compared to 67 confirmed cases that had been identified as part of the prior
      study. A total of 39 confirmed cases were found by both studies (sensitivity =
      58.21%, 95% CI: 45.52-70.15%; positive predictive value = 90.70%, 95% CI:
      77.86-97.41%; negative predictive value = 99.83%, 95% CI: 99.76-99.89% for HIE
      data). CONCLUSION: Despite limitations, HIE systems could be used for rapid
      newborn microcephaly surveillance, especially in the many jurisdictions where
      more labor-intensive approaches are not feasible. Future work is needed to
      improve electronic medical record documentation quality to improve sensitivity
      and reduce misclassification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the
      greater need for information generated by bundled payment reimbursement and the
      use of Health Information Exchange (HIE). METHODS: The study is based on a
      secondary data analysis using theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) Healthcare
      IT Database and the AHA Annual Survey. A logistic regression was used to test the
      likelihood of hospitals participating in HIE if they were involved in bundled
      payment reimbursement. Negative binomial, ordered logistic and Poisson regression
      models were used to determine the associations between bundled payment
      reimbursement and health information sharing in terms of breadth, volume, and
      diversity, respectively. RESULTS: Hospitals in bundled payment programs were more
      likely to send and receive information through HIE and tosend information to
      different types of health providers but not to receive. They were also more
      likely to exchange different types of health information and to use HIE more
      often. CONCLUSIONS: The greater need for collaboration of hospitals participating
      in bundled payment programs was associated with greater information sharing among
      organizations through HIE, but different providers involved in the episode of
      care play different roles in HIE.

PG  - 710-723
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2020.1748232 [doi]
AB  - Coordinating care across hospitals has been identified as a patient safety risk
      as referrals are often paper-based and poorly documented. Electronic referral
      systems have the potential to improve the situation but can fail to gain uptake. 
      We applied a human factors/ergonomics (HFE) approach to place analysis of local
      workflow and user engagement central to the development of a new regional
      electronic referral system. The intervention was evaluated with a
      before-and-after study. Referral quality improved, referrals containing
      sufficient clinical information for continuation of care increased from 36.9% to 
      83.5% and completeness of referral information significantly improved. There was 
      a 35.7% reduction in the number of calls to the on-call specialist, and the mean 
      period between admission and surgery for expedited transfers was reduced.
      Applying HFE informed design with use-based evidence; the system maintains
      sustained uptake three years after implementation. Reliable recording of
      information translates to better patient safety during inter-hospital
      transitions. Practitioners summary: This study developed, implemented and
      evaluated a clinical referral system using a human factors approach. Process
      analysis and usability studies were used to inform the application requirements
      and design. Region-wide implementation in hospitals resulted in the improved
      quality and completeness of clinical referral information and efficiencies in the
      referral process.

AB  - The introduction of bundled payment reimbursement focuses on rewarding efficient 
      and high-quality care. In order for bundled payment programs to be successful,
      collaboration across care settings is essential. Consequently, the introduction
      of this reimbursement program is expected to be associated with an increase of
      Health Information Exchange (HIE) among health providers. This paper aims at
      understanding how the use of HIE can be shaped by organization-specific factors
      such as trust, power, organizational culture, and leadership, especially when
      participating in bundled payment initiatives. The study was based on qualitative 
      semi-structured interviews with hospital administrators. Very diverse opinions
      arose from the interviewees, which leads to the main conclusion that policymakers
      should take into account differences between diverse hospital settings when
      adopting policies regarding technological innovations.
