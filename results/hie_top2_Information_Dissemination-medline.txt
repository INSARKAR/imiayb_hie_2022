TI  - How Does Electronic Health Information Exchange Affect Hospital Performance
      Efficiency? The Effects of Breadth and Depth of Information Sharing.
PG  - 212-228
LID - 10.1097/JHM-D-16-00041 [doi]
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This research was motivated by the large investment in health 
      information technology (IT) by hospitals and the inconsistent findings related to
      the effects of health IT adoption on hospital performance. Building on resource
      orchestration theory and the information systems literature, the authors
      developed a research model to investigate how the configuration strategies for
      sharing information under health IT systems affect hospital efficiency. The
      hypotheses were tested using data from the 2010 annual and IT surveys of the
      American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services case mix 
      index, and U.S. Census Bureau's small-area income and poverty estimates. The
      study revealed that in health IT systems, the breadth (extent) and depth (level
      of detail) of digital information sharing among stakeholders each has a
      curvilinear relationship with hospital efficiency. In addition, breadth and depth
      reinforce each other's positive effects and attenuate each other's negative
      effects, and their balance has a positive effect on hospital efficiency. The
      results of this research have the potential to enrich the literature on the value
      of adopting health IT systems as well as in providing practitioner guidelines for
      meaningful use.

TI  - Patients' Perceptions of Different Information Exchange Mechanisms: An
      Exploratory Study in the United States.
PG  - 162-178
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1721784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients may seek health care services from various providers during 
      treatment. These providers could serve in a network (affiliated) or practice
      separately (unaffiliated). Thus, using secure and reliable health information
      exchange (HIE) mechanisms would be critical to transfer sensitive personal health
      information (PHI) across distances. Studying patients' perceptions and opinions
      about exchange mechanisms could help health care providers build more complete
      HIEs' databases and develop robust privacy policies, consent processes, and
      patient education programs. OBJECTIVES: Due to the exploratory nature of this
      study, we aim to shed more light on public perspectives (benefits, concerns, and 
      risks) associated with the four data exchange practices in the health care
      sector. METHODS: In this study, we compared public perceptions and expectations
      regarding four common types of exchange mechanisms used in the United States
      (i.e., traditional, direct, query-based, patient-mediated exchange mechanisms).
      Traditional is an exchange through fax, paper mailing, or phone calls, direct is 
      a provider-to-provider exchange, query-based is sharing patient data with a
      central repository, and patient-mediated is an exchange mechanism in which
      patients can access data and monitor sharing. Data were collected from 1,624
      subjects using an online survey to examine the benefits, risks, and concerns
      associated with the four exchange mechanisms from patients' perspectives.
      RESULTS: Findings indicate that several concerns and risks such as privacy
      concerns, security risks, trust issues, and psychological risks are raised.
      Besides, multiple benefits such as access to complete information, communication 
      improvement, timely and convenient information sharing, cost-saving, and medical 
      error reduction are highlighted by respondents. Through consideration of all
      risks and benefits associated with the four exchange mechanisms, the direct HIE
      mechanism was selected by respondents as the most preferred mechanism of
      information exchange among providers. More than half of the respondents (56.18%) 
      stated that overall they favored direct exchange over the other mechanisms.
      42.70% of respondents expected to be more likely to share their PHI with health
      care providers who implemented and utilized a direct exchange mechanism. 43.26%
      of respondents believed that they would support health care providers to leverage
      a direct HIE mechanism for sharing their PHI with other providers. The results
      exhibit that individuals expect greater benefits and fewer adverse effects from
      direct HIE among health care providers. Overall, the general public sentiment is 
      more in favor of direct data transfer. Our results highlight that greater public 
      trust in exchange mechanisms is required, and information privacy and security
      risks must be addressed before the widespread implementation of such mechanisms. 
      CONCLUSION: This exploratory study's findings could be interesting for health
      care providers and HIE policymakers to analyze how consumers perceive the current
      exchange mechanisms, what concerns should be addressed, and how the exchange
      mechanisms could be modified to meet consumers' needs.

TI  - The impact of data entry structures on perceptions of individuals with chronic
      mental disorders and physical diseases towards health information sharing.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Collecting, integrating, and sharing mental and
      physical health information can enhance the care process of patients and improve 
      the completeness of patient databases in the health information exchange (HIE)
      networks. There is a need to encourage patients with physical and mental
      disorders to share their health information with providers. Data entry interfaces
      are suggested as an important factor affecting the quality of information.
      However, little is known about whether individuals with different diseases
      (mental and physical) care for the data entry structure in sharing personal
      health information (PHI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conduct four experiments to
      examine the impact of different health problems (mental vs. physical) and types
      of data entry interfaces (structured vs. unstructured) on individuals'
      perceptions of information quality and their willingness to share their health
      information. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate that the type of disease and degree of
      data entry structure significantly influence individuals' perceptions of
      usefulness, accessibility, concise presentation, understandability, psychological
      risk, privacy concern, stigma, and willingness to share health information.
      DISCUSSION: People with mental disorders prefer structured data interfaces as
      they perceive that a high degree of data entry structure can protect their
      privacy and mitigate stigma and psychological risk more than unstructured
      interfaces. Individuals with physical illnesses favor structured interfaces for
      their format, which is brief, comprehensive, accessible, useful, and
      understandable. People suffering from physical diseases are more likely to share 
      their information when a highly-structured data entry interface is used.
      Moreover, individuals with mental disorders are less likely to disclose their
      information when providers collect health records using an unstructured data
      entry interface. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the best level of
      structure for data entry interfaces could be designed at the point of care
      consistent with patients' health status and their type of diseases to improve the
      success of HIE networks.

TI  - A mixed-method service evaluation of health information exchange in England:
      technology acceptance and barriers and facilitators to adoption.
PG  - 737
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06771-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The need for information exchange and integrated care has stimulated 
      the development of interoperability solutions that bring together patient data
      across the health and care system to enable effective information sharing. Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) solutions have been shown to be effective in
      supporting patient care, however, user adoption often varies among users and care
      settings. This service evaluation aimed to measure user acceptance of HIE and
      explore barriers and facilitators to its wider uptake. METHODS: A mixed-method
      study design was used. A questionnaire was developed using the Unified Theory of 
      Acceptance and Use of Technology and administered to HIE users to assess
      technology acceptance. Pearson Chi(2) tests were used to examine differences in
      acceptance between user groups and care settings. Web-based, semi-structured
      interviews were conducted drawing on the Normalisation Process Theory to explore 
      barriers and facilitators to adoption. Interview data were analysed thematically 
      using the Framework Approach. RESULTS: A total of 105 HIE users completed the
      survey and another 12 participated in the interviews. Significant differences
      were found in HIE acceptance between users groups and care settings, with high
      adopters demonstrating higher acceptance and social care users showing lower
      acceptance. Participants identified several drivers to adoption, including
      increased information accessibility, better care coordination, informed
      decision-making, improved patient care, reduced duplication of procedures, and
      time and cost savings. However, they also highlighted a number of barriers, such 
      as lack of awareness about the solution and its value, suboptimal communication
      strategies, inadequate training and lack of resources for knowledge
      dissemination, absence of champions to support the implementation, lack of
      end-user involvement in the implementation and evaluation of HIE, unclear
      accountability and responsibility for the overall success of the programme, and
      patient confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Working to better engage
      stakeholders, considering the needs of users from different care settings,
      providing users with training resources and support to increase their knowledge
      and confidence in using the system, developing implementation strategies to seek 
      user feedback and monitor performance, and using communication strategies to
      increase awareness of the product and its value, can help improve uptake and
      adoption of HIE.

TI  - Barriers to exchanging healthcare information in inter-municipal healthcare
      services: a qualitative case study.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0701-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, inter-municipal cooperation in healthcare services
      has been an important measure implemented to meet future demographic changes in
      western countries. This entails an increased focus on communication and
      information sharing across organisational borders. Technology enables efficient
      and effective solutions to enhance such cooperation. However, the systems in the 
      healthcare sector tend not to communicate with one another. There is a lack of
      literature focusing on communication and information sharing in inter-municipal
      healthcare services. The aim of this article is to investigate both the
      characteristics of communication and information sharing, and the factors that
      serve as barriers to communication and information sharing for employees in
      inter-municipal healthcare services. METHODS: In this study, a qualitative case
      study approach is used to investigate both characteristics of communication and
      information sharing, and factors enabling barriers to communication and
      information sharing for employees in newly established inter-municipal healthcare
      services. Data collection methods were individual interviews, focus group
      interviews, observation studies and a workshop. A total of 18 persons
      participated in the study. The interviews, observations and workshop were
      conducted over a period of ten months. RESULTS: Communication and information
      sharing practices were found to be complex and characterised by multiple actors, 
      information types and a combination of multiple actions. Findings indicate that
      1. IT capability and usability 2. Differences 3. Privacy, confidentiality and
      security and 4. Awareness are all factors enabling barriers to communication and 
      information sharing in inter-municipal healthcare services. Specifically, these
      barriers were related to lack of EHR usability, inadequate workflow processes,
      digital systems incompatibility, the understanding of needs in different systems 
      and knowledge and practices regarding privacy and confidentiality. CONCLUSION: By
      focusing on the context of inter-municipal cooperation when assessing
      communication and information sharing in healthcare services, this article
      contributes to close a gap in existing knowledge. The perspective of the
      employees provides useful insight, and findings can be relevant for future theory
      development and for managers and policymakers in inter-municipal services.

TI  - Accessing and sharing health information for post-discharge stroke care through a
      national health information exchange platform - a case study.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0816-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients and citizens need access to their health information to get 
      a retrospective as well as a prospective view on their care and rehabilitation
      processes. However, patients' health information is stored in several health
      information systems and interoperability problems often hamper accessibility. In 
      Sweden a national health information exchange (HIE) platform has been developed
      that enables information exchange between different health information systems.
      The aim of this study is to explore the opportunities and limitations of
      accessing and interacting with important health information through the Swedish
      national HIE platform. METHODS: A single case study approach was used for this
      study as an in-depth understanding of the subject was needed. A fictive patient
      case with a pseudo-name was created based on an interview with a stroke
      coordinator in Stockholm County. Information access through the national health
      information exchange platform and available service contracts and application
      programming interfaces were studied using different scenarios. RESULTS: Based on 
      the scenarios created in this study, patients would be able to access some health
      related information from their electronic health records using the national
      health information exchange platform. However, there is necessary information
      which is not retrievable as it is either stored in electronic health records and 
      eHealth services which are not connected to the national health information
      exchange platform or there is no service contract developed for these types of
      information. In addition, patients are not able to share information with
      healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The national Swedish HIE platform provides 
      the building blocks needed to allow patients online access to their health
      information in a fragmented and distributed health system. However, more complex 
      interaction scenarios allowing patients to communicate with their health care
      providers or to update their health related information are not yet supported.
      Therefore it is of great importance to involve patients throughout the design and
      evaluation of eHealth services on both national and local levels to ensure that
      their needs for interoperability and information exchange are met.

AB  - Genetic variants causing underlying pharmacogenetic and disease phenotypes have
      been used as the basis for clinical decision-making. However, due to the lack of 
      standards for next-generation sequencing (NGS) pipelines, reproducing genetic
      variants among institutions is still difficult. The aim of this study is to show 
      how many important variants for clinical decisions can be individually detected
      using different pipelines. Genetic variants were derived from 105 breast cancer
      patient target DNA sequences via three different variant-calling pipelines.
      HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2 tumor-only mode in the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK),
      and VarScan were used in variant calling from the sequence read data processed by
      the same NGS preprocessing tools using Variant Effect Predictor. GATK
      HaplotypeCaller, VarScan, and MuTect2 found 25,130, 16,972, and 4232 variants,
      comprising 1491, 1400, and 321 annotated variants with ClinVar significance,
      respectively. The average number of ClinVar significant variants in the patients 
      was 769.43, 16.50% of the variants were detected by only one variant caller.
      Despite variants with significant impact on clinical decision-making, the
      detected variants are different for each algorithm. To utilize genetic variants
      in the clinical field, a strict standard for NGS pipelines is essential.

TI  - Medical reliability of a video-sharing website: The gingival recession model.
PG  - 175-183
LID - 10.1111/eje.12417 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the quality of the scientific/clinical information in
      dentistry delivered by videos hosted by a popular video-sharing website. METHODS:
      The gingival recession condition was used as a model and YouTube as the video
      hosting service. A systematic observation of videos containing information on
      gingival recession was conducted. Videos were analysed to evaluate (i) the
      scientific reliability and quality of the information using Global Quality Scale 
      (GQS) and DISCREN criteria; and (ii) the understandability of this information
      using a tailor-made custom comprehensiveness index (CI). RESULTS: One hundred and
      eighty videos were identified. Videos dealing with surgical procedures were not
      included in the present review. After selection, 41 videos were analysed. The
      mean GQS was 2.34 on a 0-5 scale, and 25 (61%) videos showed clear aims according
      to DISCREN criteria. Misleading content was observed in eight videos (19.5%). The
      scientific sources of information were unclear in 26 (63.4%) videos. All videos
      failed to give additional references for supplemental information. Only three
      videos (7%) provided basic information on aetiology, clinical presentations and
      management of gingival recession. Based on 0-2 CI scores, three, nine and 29
      videos had a score of 2, 1 and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present model
      indicates that social media websites aiming to provide health information should 
      be carefully accounted, especially when dealing with dentistry. It also suggests 
      professional involvement to improve the quality of the delivered information.

LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab039 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future of
      value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures
      can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how
      quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health
      record (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE)
      operating as a multisource registry for quality measurement. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Data were sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018.
      Organizations represented both ambulatory care practices and health systems
      participating in the state of Kansas HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures
      for 5300 patients were calculated using the data from an individual EHR source
      and contrasted to calculations when HIE data were added to locally recorded data.
      RESULTS: A total of 79% of patients received care at more than 1 facility during 
      the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable quality measure calculations
      were compared using data from the originating organization vs longitudinal data
      from the HIE. A total of 15% of all quality measure calculations changed (P <
      .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19% of patients. Changes in
      quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations.
      DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using
      single-site EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data
      sharing significantly changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare
      payments, patient safety, and care quality. CONCLUSIONS: Federal, state, and
      commercial programs that use quality measurement as part of reimbursement could
      promote more accurate and representative quality measurement through methods that
      increase clinical data sharing.

TI  - Technology, Incentives, or Both? Factors Related to Level of Hospital Health
      Information Exchange.
PG  - 3285-3308
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.12838 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the level of health information exchange (HIE) in
      U.S. hospitals is related to technology capabilities, incentives to exchange, or 
      both. STUDY SETTING: A total of 1,812 hospitals attesting to stage 2 of
      Medicare's Meaningful Use Incentive Program through April 2016. STUDY DESIGN:
      Hospital-level, multivariate OLS regression with state fixed effects was used to 
      analyze the relationship between technology capability and incentives measures,
      and percent of care transitions with summary of care records (SCRs) sent
      electronically to subsequent providers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stage 2 hospitals
      reported sending SCRs electronically for an average of 41 percent (median = 33
      percent) of transitions. HIE level is related to four capability measures, one
      incentive measure, and one measure that is related to both capability and
      incentive. Percent of transitions with SCRs sent electronically was 3 percentage 
      points higher (95 percent CI: 0.1-5.1) for hospitals with a third-party HIE
      vendor, 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 0.5-5.4) for hospitals with an
      EHR vendor as their HIE vendor, and 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      0.4-5.4) for hospitals that automatically alert primary care providers. The
      direction and statistical significance of the relationships between specific EHR 
      vendor and electronic SCR transmission level varied by vendor. Nonprofits and
      government hospitals performed 5 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      1.5-9.1) and 8 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 3.4-12.3) than
      for-profits. Hospitals in systems performed 3 percentage points higher (95
      percent CI: 0.8-6.1). CONCLUSION: The overall level of HIE is low, with hospitals
      sending an SCR electronically for less than half of patient transitions. Specific
      hospital characteristics related to both technology capabilities and incentives
      were associated with higher levels of HIE.

LID - 10.1111/hsc.12958 [doi]
AB  - In light of the challenges posed by an ageing population and tighter public
      budgets, governments worldwide are seeking innovative ways of improving health
      service delivery. Volunteers can contribute to such improvement, but this
      requires effective coordination and communication between volunteers and
      healthcare employees. In this case study, conducted in two Norwegian
      municipalities during September-October 2017, the aim was to understand how
      collaboration and coordination is carried out between several stakeholders:
      volunteers, volunteer family members of healthcare service users and healthcare
      employees. Our results show that daily cooperation was largely unsystematic, and 
      stakeholders employed various informal communication procedures. Recruitment of
      volunteers was based on word of mouth and was coordinated by telephone and email.
      All processes were paper based, including contracting and confidential
      agreements. This unsystematic approach resulted in uncoordinated activities
      characterised by time-consuming processes, with no quality assurance. We
      concluded that stakeholders would benefit from a technology solution that
      supports more systematic processes of recruitment, management and monitoring.
      This article outlines the challenges and needs for information exchange and
      communication between stakeholders. Furthermore, it describes possible
      functionality in a digital system that can address these needs, and hence improve
      coordination, quality of services and resource use.

TI  - A Survey Of Health Information Exchange Organizations In Advance Of A Nationwide 
      Connectivity Framework.

AB  - After more than a decade of investment in electronic health information exchange 
      (HIE), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
      is advancing a national framework-the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common
      Agreement-to connect islands of electronic data sharing. This national framework 
      creates new potential opportunities and challenges for state and local health
      information organizations (HIOs). We undertook our sixth national HIO survey to
      assess the current state of HIOs and to newly examine anticipated responses to
      the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement. We identified eighty-nine
      operational HIOs, down from 106 in 2014. Although more than half of HIOs
      struggled with financial viability and competition from health information
      technology vendor-based HIE networks, many are large in scale, offer a breadth of
      services to diverse participants, and engage in network-to-network connectivity. 
      Looking ahead, 56 percent of HIOs planned to participate in the Trusted Exchange 
      Framework and Common Agreement, and 41 percent were unsure. As the Trusted
      Exchange Framework and Common Agreement advances basic network-to-network
      connectivity, HIOs that have experience with such connectivity while also
      offering value-added services will be well positioned for sustainability and
      growth.

TI  - Information blocking remains prevalent at the start of 21st Century Cures Act:
      results from a survey of health information exchange organizations.
PG  - 727-732
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent policy making aims to prevent health systems, lectronic health 
      record (EHR) vendors, and others from blocking the electronic sharing of patient 
      data necessary for clinical care. We sought to assess the prevalence of
      information blocking prior to enforcement of these rules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We conducted a national survey of health information exchange organizations
      (HIEs) to measure the prevalence of information blocking behaviors observed by
      these third-party entities. Eighty-nine of 106 HIEs (84%) meeting the inclusion
      criteria responded. RESULTS: The majority (55%) of HIEs reported that EHR vendors
      at least sometimes engage in information blocking, while 30% of HIEs reported the
      same for health systems. The most common type of information blocking behavior
      EHR vendors engaged in was setting unreasonably high prices, which 42% of HIEs
      reported routinely observing. The most common type of information blocking
      behavior health systems engaged in was refusing to share information, which 14%
      of HIEs reported routinely observing. Reported levels of vendor information
      blocking was correlated with regional competition among vendors and information
      blocking was concentrated in some geographic regions. DISCUSSION: Our findings
      are consistent with early reports, revealing persistently high levels of
      information blocking and important variation by actor, type of behavior, and
      geography. These trends reflect the observations and experiences of HIEs and
      their potential biases. Nevertheless, these data serve as a baseline against
      which to measure the impact of new regulations and to inform policy makers about 
      the most common types of information blocking behaviors. CONCLUSION: Enforcement 
      aimed at reducing information blocking should consider variation in prevalence
      and how to most effectively target efforts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media has provided an online environment for patients to
      discuss regarding their health and seek medical information. The primary aim of
      our study was to analyze the quality of information shared on YouTube regarding
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). RESULTS: More than half of the
      videos, 91 (57.23%) had duration of fewer than 5 min. Only 8 (5.03%) videos were 
      rated as highly useful whereas 61 (38.36%) videos were misleading. Interestingly,
      there was a significant higher (1203.38 +/- 395) likes in the misleading group of
      videos, compared to 162.13 +/- 169.63 likes in the very useful group, P = 0.012. 
      Only a small fraction of videos had very useful information on ADHD. There is a
      need for high-quality, evidence-based, educational videos on ADHD for patient
      education.

      Knowledge Sharing Community.
PG  - 1604392
LID - 10.1155/2019/1604392 [doi]
AB  - The medical knowledge sharing community provides users with an open platform for 
      accessing medical resources and sharing medical knowledge, treatment experience, 
      and emotions. Compared with the recipients of general commodities, the recipients
      in the medical knowledge sharing community pay more attention to the intensity or
      overall evaluation of emotional vocabularies in the comments, such as treatment
      effects, prices, service attitudes, and other aspects. Therefore, the overall
      evaluation is not a key factor in medical service comments, but the semantics of 
      the emotional polarity is the key to affect recipients of the medical
      information. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning emotion
      identification method (ALEIM) based on mutual information feature weight, which
      captures the correlation and redundancy of features. In order to evaluate the
      proposed method's effectiveness, we use four basic corpus libraries crawled from 
      the Haodf's online platform and employ Taiwan University NTUSD Simplified Chinese
      Emotion Dictionary for emotion classification. The experimental results show that
      our proposed ALEIM method has a better performance for the identification of the 
      low-frequency words' redundant features in comments of the online medical
      knowledge sharing community.

TI  - Sharing information electronically with other hospitals is associated with
      increased sharing of patients.
PG  - 128-135
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13240 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One potential benefit of greater electronic health information
      exchange is a reduction in the effort required for patients to switch between
      providers. We therefore assessed whether hospital participation in health
      information organizations (HIOs) led to increased patient sharing. DATA SOURCES: 
      Secondary data from 2010 to 2016. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital-pair and year
      fixed effects regression models, we assessed change in patient sharing volume
      following HIO participation by hospitals and compared the effect by the level of 
      market competition and by hospital size. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: We used
      national data on hospital participation in HIOs from the American Hospital
      Association Information Technology Supplement and data on the volume of Medicare 
      patients shared between pairs of hospitals from 2010 to 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      The volume of patients shared between hospitals increased by 2.6 percent when
      both hospitals participated in a health information organization (P = .008, 95%
      CI: 0.7%-4.5%). This increase was greater in competitive markets (3.1 percent
      increase, P = .03 95% CI: 0.3%-5.9%) and between large hospitals (4.3 percent
      increase, P = .007 95% CI: 1.2%-7.3%). Participation by only one hospital in a
      pair had no effect on patient sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an
      important policy goal motivating the investment in health information exchange
      has been at least partially achieved. However, our results also support hospital 
      concerns about the competitive implications of engaging in health information
      exchange. HIO participation appears to facilitate patient movement between
      hospitals, likely by lowering switching costs and resulting in greater
      competition.

TI  - What do health providers and patients tweet about schizophrenia?
PG  - 613-618
LID - 10.1111/eip.12888 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Twitter is the most commonly used social media forum in public health and is
      considered the radio of the internet. Many health providers utilize this media to
      disseminate health information. Patient use of social media for mental health
      topics encourages providers to disseminate quality information and to develop
      virtual collaborative learning environments. This study explored trends in health
      information exchanged by patients, doctors and health organizations about
      schizophrenia through analyses of tweets posted using the #schizophrenia.
      METHODS: The likelihood that the information distributed by each user type was
      scholarly was assessed via qualitative and logistic regression analyses.
      Specifically, a sequential exploratory multimethod of data analysis guided this
      study with a sample of 981 tweets. RESULTS: Most tweets focused on the
      improvement of schizophrenia literacy (n = 366) followed by personal
      experiences/motivational stories (n = 207) and biological explanations of the
      disorder (n = 158). Logistic regression results indicated that compared to
      doctors, patients were less likely to tweet with a scholarly source (OR = 0.481, 
      CI = 0.311, .744; P < .001). All users were less likely to include a scholarly
      source when tweeting about schizophrenia literacy, personal/motivational
      experiences, campaign/organizational events or illness management in comparison
      to those who tweeted about biological explanations of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: 
      Results suggest all users disseminated beneficial information that can increase
      public schizophrenia literacy and illness management, while connecting
      individuals to organizational events targeting this debilitating disorder. Health
      providers are encouraged to establish a presence on social media to share
      scholarly work with patients and promote prompt treatment for schizophrenia.

TI  - The efficacy of public health information for encouraging radon gas awareness and
      testing varies by audience age, sex and profession.

AB  - Radioactive radon inhalation is a leading cause of lung cancer and underlies an
      ongoing public health crisis. Radon exposure prevention strategies typically
      begin by informing populations about health effects, and their initial efficacy
      is measured by how well and how fast information convinces individuals to test
      properties. This communication process is rarely individualized, and there is
      little understanding if messages impact diverse demographics equally. Here, we
      explored how 2,390 people interested in radon testing differed in their reaction 
      to radon's public health information and their subsequent decision to test. Only 
      20% were prompted to radon test after 1 encounter with awareness information,
      while 65% required 2-5 encounters over several months, and 15% needed 6 to > 10
      encounters over many years. People who most delayed testing were more likely to
      be men or involved in engineering, architecture, real estate and/or physical
      science-related professions. Social pressures were not a major factor influencing
      radon testing. People who were the least worried about radon health risks were
      older and/or men, while negative emotional responses to awareness information
      were reported more by younger people, women and/or parents. This highlights the
      importance of developing targeted demographic messaging to create effective radon
      exposure prevention strategies.

TI  - The associations between query-based and directed health information exchange
      with potentially avoidable use of health care services.
PG  - 981-993
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13169 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of two approaches (directed and query-based) to
      health information exchange (HIE) on potentially avoidable use of health care
      services. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data on ambulatory care providers' adoption
      of HIE were merged with Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2008 to 2014.
      Providers were from 13 counties in New York served by the Rochester Regional
      Health Information Organization (RHIO). STUDY DESIGN: Linear regression models
      with provider and year fixed effects were used to estimate changes in the
      probability of utilization outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to
      providers adopting directed and/or query-based HIE compared with beneficiaries
      attributed to providers who had not adopted HIE. DATA COLLECTION: Providers' HIE 
      adoption status was determined through Rochester RHIO registration records. RHIO 
      and claims data were linked via National Provider Identifiers. PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Query-based HIE adoption was associated with a 0.2 percentage point
      reduction in the probability of an ambulatory care sensitive hospitalization and 
      a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of an unplanned readmission.
      Directed HIE adoption was not associated with any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) EHR certification criteria
      includes requirements for directed HIE, but not query-based HIE. Pending further 
      research, certification criteria should place equal weight on facilitating
      query-based and directed exchange.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the
      greater need for information generated by bundled payment reimbursement and the
      use of Health Information Exchange (HIE). METHODS: The study is based on a
      secondary data analysis using theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) Healthcare
      IT Database and the AHA Annual Survey. A logistic regression was used to test the
      likelihood of hospitals participating in HIE if they were involved in bundled
      payment reimbursement. Negative binomial, ordered logistic and Poisson regression
      models were used to determine the associations between bundled payment
      reimbursement and health information sharing in terms of breadth, volume, and
      diversity, respectively. RESULTS: Hospitals in bundled payment programs were more
      likely to send and receive information through HIE and tosend information to
      different types of health providers but not to receive. They were also more
      likely to exchange different types of health information and to use HIE more
      often. CONCLUSIONS: The greater need for collaboration of hospitals participating
      in bundled payment programs was associated with greater information sharing among
      organizations through HIE, but different providers involved in the episode of
      care play different roles in HIE.

TI  - The (Re)-Relaunching of the DMP, the French Shared Medical Record: New Features
      to Improve Uptake and Use.
PG  - 256-260
AB  - Health care delivery for patients with chronic conditions is complex and
      confusing. Care is often fragmented, less effective, and sometimes harmful. Given
      the potential for EHRs and other health IT systems to facilitate information flow
      between providers, patients, and settings, health IT-based measures are of
      particular interest for care coordination. Health information exchange (HIE) has 
      the potential to improve the quality of healthcare by enabling providers with
      better access to patient information from multiple sources at the point of care. 
      However, many barriers to HIE use have been reported. Another solution relies on 
      the implementation of a nationwide centralized framework of clinical information 
      sharing with "new" secure online care records stored in specifically created
      platforms. The French DMP follows this model but the adoption of the tool has
      been historically poor. In 2016, a renovation of the DMP program was launched in 
      nine pilot French departments and new features have been implemented: the DMP
      content has been fully specified, patients can create their DMP by themselves,
      DMPs are automatically filled in by data claims, a mobile app has been developed,
      and technical issues about DMP and EHRs interoperability have been resolved. In
      October 2017, over 900,000 people have a DMP with an average new DMP being
      created every minute. These results have to be confirmed in 2018 when the new DMP
      will be deployed on the whole French territory.

TI  - Applying Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange and Persistent
      Monitoring for Clinical Trials.
PG  - 1167-1175
AB  - "Blockchain" is a distributed ledger technology originally applied in the
      financial sector. This technology ensures the integrity of transactions without
      third-party validation. Its functions of decentralized transaction validation,
      data provenance, data sharing, and data integration are a good fit for the needs 
      of health information exchange and clinical trials. We investigated the current
      workflow of Health Information Exchange and clinical trials; conducted design
      thinking processes with clinicians, trial managers, informaticians, and
      blockchain professionals; and implemented a private blockchain model to tackle
      known issues. We used coded Smart Contract regulations to simulate several
      scenarios in healthcare processes. This proof-of-concept work provides a feasible
      simulation for potential solutions to monitor clinical trials across different
      census regions persistently. Various levels of data access privileges have been
      designed to utilize a suite of customized Smart Contract settings. These settings
      emulate the workflow protocols for the monitoring entities, trial sponsors,
      clinical sponsors and participating subjects. Keywords: Blockchain, Smart
      Contract, Health Information Exchange, Clinical Trial, Persistent Monitoring.

TI  - Addressing the Socio-Technical Challenges of Health Information Exchange
      Adoption: DataWell in Greater Manchester.
PG  - 790-794
AB  - Several high profile, problematic UK health data-sharing projects have shaped NHS
      professionals' and the public's opinion about NHS data-sharing projects, and
      there is a substantial body of evidence identifying barriers to Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) adoption. Socio-technical factors are a significant
      consideration and this paper describes the approach taken to address these
      concerns in the design and implementation of a HIE for Greater Manchester.
