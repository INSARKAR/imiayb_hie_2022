TI  - Racial differences in patient consent policy preferences for electronic health
      information exchange.
PG  - 717-725
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between demographic
      variables, such as race and gender, and patient consent policy preferences for
      health information exchange as well as self-report by VHA enrollees of
      information continuity between Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and community
      non-VHA heath care providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected between 
      March 25, 2016 and August 22, 2016 in an online survey of 19 567 veterans. Three 
      questions from the 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey,
      which addressed care continuity, were included. The survey also included
      questions about consent policy preference regarding opt-out, opt-in, and "break
      the glass" consent policies. RESULTS: VHA enrollees had comparable proportions of
      unnecessary laboratory testing and conflicting information from providers when
      compared with the United States sample in the Commonwealth Survey. However, they 
      endorsed medical record information being unavailable between organizations more 
      highly. Demographic variables were associated with gaps in care continuity as
      well as consent policy preferences, with 56.8% of Whites preferring an opt-out
      policy as compared with 40.3% of Blacks, 44.9% of Hispanic Latinos, 48.3% of
      Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 38.3% of Native Americans (P < .001). DISCUSSION:
      Observed large differences by race and ethnicity in privacy preferences for
      electronic health information exchange should inform implementation of these
      programs to ensure cultural sensitivity. Veterans experienced care continuity
      comparable to a general United States sample, except for less effective exchange 
      of health records between heath care organizations. VHA followed an opt-in
      consent policy at the time of this survey which may underlie this gap.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are associated with inefficient and
      fragmented use of healthcare services. The Chesapeake Regional Information System
      for Our Patients, Inc. (CRISP) is a Health Information Exchange (HIE) linking
      disparate systems of care in the mid-Atlantic region. METHODS: This article
      describes applications of HIE for tracking hospital service utilization in
      substance use disorder clinical and services research, drawing upon data from one
      of the first studies approved to access the CRISP HIE. Participants were 200
      medical/surgical inpatients with comorbid opioid, cocaine, and/or alcohol use
      disorder (45.5 % female; 56.5 % black; 77.5 % opioid use disorder; 42.0 %
      homeless). This study compared HIE-identified hospital service utilization with
      conventional methods of participant self-report during in-person research
      follow-ups (3-, 6-, and 12-months post-discharge) and electronic health record
      (EHR) review from the hospital system of the index admission. RESULTS: This
      sample exhibited high levels of hospital utilization, which would have been
      underestimated using conventional methods. Relying exclusively on self-report in 
      the 12-month observation period would have identified only 33.8 % of 429
      inpatient hospitalizations and 9.0 % of 1,287 ED visits, due to both
      loss-to-follow-up and failure to report events. Even combining self-report with
      single-system EHR review identified only 66.2 % of inpatient hospitalizations and
      59.8 % of ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: CRISP HIE data were superior to conventional
      methods for ascertaining hospital service utilization in this sample of patients 
      exhibiting high-volume and fragmented care. The use of HIE holds implications for
      improving rigor, safety, and efficiency in research studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a national Personal Health Record (PHR) infrastructure was
      supposed to have been introduced in Germany by law in 2006 and different
      providers are entering the market, no system has yet been widely adopted in
      Germany. There is also little information available on how current technical
      advancements affect German patients' and physicians' trust in PHR systems.
      METHODS: Supporting scenarios obtained from clinicians, this study proposes a
      concept for a German PHR system using a public cloud infrastructure, smartphone
      access and focusing on trust, privacy, and interoperability. In advance to an
      eventual implementation, a multi-center questionnaire study has been conducted to
      predict patients' and physicians' intention to use that system and evaluate their
      trust in different providers of such a system. RESULTS: Our results show that
      both patients and physicians are highly likely to use the PHR based on the
      present concept. Trust in healthcare providers exceeds trust in other
      institutions like private companies, health insurance companies, or even
      governmental institutions when offering such a PHR system. CONCLUSIONS: We
      recommend the implementation of this PHR system. To maximize patients' and
      physicians' trust in the system, it should be offered to patients by their
      healthcare provider. Further evaluation regarding its actual adoption and
      expected improvement in patient outcome based on the scenarios is advisable.

      Health Information National Trends Survey.
PG  - e24767
LID - 10.2196/24767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Online medical records are being used to organize processes in
      clinical and outpatient settings and to forge doctor-patient communication
      techniques that build mutual understanding and trust. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to
      understand the reasons why patients tend to avoid using online medical records
      and to compare the perceptions that patients have of online medical records based
      on demographics and cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from the Health
      Information National Trends Survey Cycle 3, a nationally representative survey,
      and assessed outcomes using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. The
      patients (N=4328) included in the analysis had experienced an outpatient visit
      within the previous 12 months and had answered the online behavior question
      regarding their use of online medical records. RESULTS: Patients who were
      nonusers of online medical records consisted of 58.36% of the sample (2526/4328).
      The highest nonuser rates were for patients who were Hispanic (460/683, 67.35%), 
      patients who were non-Hispanic Black (434/653, 66.46%), and patients who were
      older than 65 years (968/1520, 63.6%). Patients older than 65 years were less
      likely to use online medical records (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.84,
      P<.001). Patients who were White were more likely to use online medical records
      than patients who were Black (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.43-2.05, P<.001) or Hispanic (OR 
      1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, P<.001). Patients who were diagnosed with cancer were
      more likely to use online medical records compared to patients with no cancer (OR
      1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, P=.001). Among nonusers, older patients
      (>/=65 years old) preferred speaking directly to their health care providers (OR 
      1.76, 95% CI 1.35-2.31, P<.001), were more concerned about privacy issues caused 
      by online medical records (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22-2.66, P<.001), and felt
      uncomfortable using the online medical record systems (OR 10.55, 95% CI
      6.06-19.89, P<.001) compared to those aged 18-34 years. Patients who were Black
      or Hispanic were more concerned about privacy issues (OR 1.42, 1.09-1.84,
      P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Studies should consider social factors such as gender,
      race/ethnicity, and age when monitoring trends in eHealth use to ensure that
      eHealth use does not induce greater health status and health care disparities
      between people with different backgrounds and demographic characteristics.

      Acts emphasize health information exchange which underpins activities required to
      improve care coordination. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Using semi-structured
      interviews and surveys, we examined how providers experience electronic health
      information exchange during care coordination since these Acts were implemented, 
      with a focus on rural settings where health disparities exist. We used a
      purposive sample that included primary care, acute care hospitals, and community 
      health services in the United States. FINDINGS: We identified seven themes
      related to care coordination and information exchange: 'insufficient trust of
      data'; 'please respond'; 'just fax it'; 'care plans'; 'needle in the haystack';
      're-documentation'; and 'rural reality'. These gaps were magnified when
      information exchange was required between unaffiliated electronic health records 
      (EHRs) about shared patients, which was more pronounced in rural settings.
      CONCLUSION: Policy and incentive modifications are likely needed to overcome the 
      observed health information technology (HIT) shortcomings. Rural settings in the 
      United States accentuate problems that can be addressed through international
      medical informatics policy makers and the implementation and evaluation of
      interoperable HIT systems.

TI  - The efficacy of public health information for encouraging radon gas awareness and
      testing varies by audience age, sex and profession.
PG  - 11906
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-91479-7 [doi]
AB  - Radioactive radon inhalation is a leading cause of lung cancer and underlies an
      ongoing public health crisis. Radon exposure prevention strategies typically
      begin by informing populations about health effects, and their initial efficacy
      is measured by how well and how fast information convinces individuals to test
      properties. This communication process is rarely individualized, and there is
      little understanding if messages impact diverse demographics equally. Here, we
      explored how 2,390 people interested in radon testing differed in their reaction 
      to radon's public health information and their subsequent decision to test. Only 
      20% were prompted to radon test after 1 encounter with awareness information,
      while 65% required 2-5 encounters over several months, and 15% needed 6 to > 10
      encounters over many years. People who most delayed testing were more likely to
      be men or involved in engineering, architecture, real estate and/or physical
      science-related professions. Social pressures were not a major factor influencing
      radon testing. People who were the least worried about radon health risks were
      older and/or men, while negative emotional responses to awareness information
      were reported more by younger people, women and/or parents. This highlights the
      importance of developing targeted demographic messaging to create effective radon
      exposure prevention strategies.

TI  - Potential of technology to improve the availability and use of health information
      on cancer subjects for clergy from rural communities.
PG  - 35-47
LID - 10.1111/hir.12275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and often is a
      chronic long term disease. This calls for an expanded workforce to include
      non-traditional health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To determine effectiveness of a
      cancer information training project with clergy from selected rural Appalachian
      areas to improve comfort and willingness to work as part of the cancer health
      care team. METHODS: Clergy were trained in the consumer health database of the
      National Library of Medicine MedlinePlus.gov. Exercises were required that were
      done using an iPad tablet with an online curriculum. They were also taught how to
      do a population health assessment of their particular area and develop a health
      ministry for their church. RESULTS: Three key elements were confirmed that would 
      enable replication of the pilot: access to medlineplus, programmed learning
      modules using mobile technology such as iPads, and staff support including
      librarians and medical staff. With these key elements, the cancer project is
      potentially replicable with other groups beyond clergy. CONCLUSION: Knowledge
      about population health, built on new awareness and topical health knowledge, and
      using new skills to identify relevant information and library resources, could
      open minds and enhance community support for preventive and medical
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of electronic health (eHealth) information and
      disease-related community forums has grown over the last decade. Although
      patients and families frequently use these resources, their content has not been 
      characterized in terms users, content, or reliability of information. eHealth
      communities therefore represent a potentially valuable but uncharted source of
      information about key patient issues, communication terminology, and unmet needs.
      We hypothesized that eHealth forums would contain terminology, themes, and advice
      inconsistent with resources from medical providers and references. To test this
      hypothesis, we performed a qualitative analysis of posts and responses from an
      open-access peripheral artery disease (PAD) eHealth community forum to
      characterize the discussion, participants, and the information being exchanged.
      METHODS: Posts were collected from an online PAD Medical Support Community forum 
      (MedHelp), which is open access, does not require participants to identify
      themselves, and is based in the United States. Posts were selected from threads
      in which the main topic was PAD, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment.
      Original posts and related responses were analyzed for thematic content, common
      vernacular, and self-reported characteristics of the participants using a
      qualitative analysis software program. Disease-specific comments and advice were 
      evaluated for congruence with contemporary PAD treatment guidelines. RESULTS: A
      total of 103 posts were collected and analyzed, including 40 original posts and
      63 responses. Forty-five percent of the original posts and 19% of the responses
      were authored by participants who self-identified as patients with PAD. The
      remaining posts were authored by people with undeclared relationships to patients
      with PAD, followed by children, spouses, and other relatives. The most common
      themes among original posts included PAD diagnosis (and differential) (25%),
      treatment (23%), epidemiology and pathophysiology (21%), disease symptoms and
      impacts on activities of daily living (15%), and health-care provider
      recommendations (13%). Themes of responses included medical advice (40.5%),
      personal experiences with PAD (32.8%), and social support (12.6%). Negative
      attitudes were identified in 10 of 18 (55.6%) posts related to experiences with
      health-care providers. Of all medical advice, 15.1% was inconsistent with
      clinical treatment guidelines. CONCLUSION: eHealth communities are a rich source 
      of information related to the experiences of patients with PAD, their treatment
      preferences, questions they consider important, and terminology that they use.
      This information can be used to understand unmet patient needs, develop
      educational resources, and improve communication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact in the adoption of electronic health records
      and health information exchanges by local health departments on population
      health. METHODS: The study analyzed 433 local health departments population-based
      data across 433 counties in the United States. Controlling for high school
      graduation rate, percentage of adults with some post- secondary education, race, 
      median household income, percentage rural, population size served, governance
      structure of local health departments and revenue, the study used multiple linear
      regression to analyze the impact in the adoption of health information technology
      by local health departments on the population health of a county. RESULTS:
      Electronic health records adoption was statistically significant at improving
      population health at the county level. Health information exchange adoption was
      not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: When local health departments adopt
      electronic health records, it improves health- related quality of life and
      reduces years of potential life lost. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The value derived from
      the adoption of electronic health records by local health departments deserves
      attention because of its abilities to enhance the services provided at local
      health departments. It is important for local health departments to use health
      information technology to electronically capture patient information to improve
      upon the services received at community health centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the specific information parents of children
      with cancer search for online. Understanding the content of parents' searches
      over time could offer insight into what matters most to parents and identify
      knowledge gaps that could inform more comprehensive approaches to family
      education and support. METHODS: We describe parents' health-related Google
      searches starting six months before cancer diagnosis and extending through the
      date of study enrollment, which was at least one month after initiating cancer
      treatment. Searches were obtained retrospectively and grouped into health-related
      and non-health-related categories. The median time to parent enrollment from date
      of cancer diagnosis was 264 days. RESULTS: Parents searched for health-related
      topics more frequently than the general population (13% vs 5%). Health-related
      searches increased in the months preceding the child's cancer diagnosis and most 
      commonly pertained to symptoms and logistics, "directions to hospital."
      Health-related search volume peaked about a month after cancer diagnosis when
      general health-related searches were present in addition to cancer-specific
      searches. Eighteen percent of health-related searches were cancer specific, and
      of these cancer-specific searches, 54% pertained to support, for example "cancer 
      quote for son." CONCLUSIONS: Google search content offers insight into what
      matters to parents of cancer patients. Understanding search content could inform 
      more comprehensive approaches to family education and support initiatives.
