TI  - Sharing health data in Belgium: A home care case study using the Vitalink
      platform.
PG  - 56-72
LID - 10.1080/17538157.2016.1269107 [doi]
AB  - In 2013, the Flemish Government launched the Vitalink platform. This initiative
      focuses on the sharing of health and welfare data to support primary healthcare. 
      In this paper, the objectives and mission of the Vitalink initiative are
      discussed. Security and privacy measures are reviewed, and the technical
      implementation of the Vitalink platform is presented. Through a case study, the
      possibility of interaction with cloud solutions for healthcare is also
      investigated upon; this was initially not the focus of Vitalink. The Vitalink
      initiative provides support for secure data sharing in primary healthcare, which 
      in the long term will improve the efficiency of care and will decrease costs.
      Based on the results of the case study, Vitalink allowed cloud solutions or
      applications not providing end-to-end security to use their system. The most
      important lesson learned during this research was the need for firm regulations
      and stipulations for cloud solutions to interact with the Vitalink platform.
      However, these are currently still vague.

TI  - Medical Data Management on Blockchain with Privacy.

AB  - Medical data are important in diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and medical
      accident investigation. The integrity and availability of medical data are the
      basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of
      medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At
      present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One
      way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control
      strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the
      patient's key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method
      is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem
      with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies
      during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the
      availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be
      reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and
      treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted
      and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the
      integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the
      sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses 
      the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the
      system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF 
      to a blockchain application.

TI  - Towards Designing a Secure Exchange Platform for Diabetes Monitoring and Therapy.
PG  - 239-246
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prominent examples of chronic
      conditions that requires an active patient self-management and a network of
      specialists. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the user and legal 
      requirements and develop a rough technology concept for a secure and
      patient-centered exchange platform. METHODS: To this end, 14 experts representing
      different stakeholders were interviewed and took part in group discussions at
      three workshops, the pertinent literature and legal texts were analyzed. RESULTS:
      The user requirements embraced a comprehensive set of use cases and the demand
      for "one platform for all" which is underlined by the right for data portability 
      according to new regulations. In order to meet these requirements a distributed
      ledger technology was proposed. CONCLUSION: We will therefore focus on a
      patient-centered application that showcases self-management and exchange with
      health specialists.

AB  - PURPOSE: Secondary usage of patient data has recently become of increasing
      interest for the development and application of computer analytic techniques.
      Strict oversight of these data is required and the individual patients themselves
      are integral to providing guidance. We sought to understand patients' attitudes
      to sharing their imaging data for research purposes. These images could provide a
      great wealth of information for researchers. METHODS: Patients from the Greater
      Toronto Area attending Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for imaging (magnetic
      resonance imagining, computed tomography, or ultrasound) examination areas were
      invited to participate in an electronic survey. RESULTS: Of the 1083 patients who
      were approached (computed tomography 609, ultrasound 314, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging 160), 798 (74%) agreed to take the survey. Overall median age was 60
      (interquartile range = 18, Q1 = 52, Q3 = 70), 52% were women, 42% had a
      university degree, and 7% had no high school diploma. In terms of willingness to 
      share de-identified medical images for research, 76% were willing (agreed and
      strongly agreed), while 7% refused. Most participants gave their family
      physicians (73%) and other physicians (57%) unconditional data access.
      Participants chose hospitals/research institutions to regulate electronic images 
      databases (70%), 89% wanted safeguards against unauthorized access to their data,
      and over 70% wanted control over who will be permitted, for how long, and the
      ability to revoke that permission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that people are
      willing to share their clinically acquired de-identified medical images for
      research studies provided that they have control over permissions and duration of
      access.

TI  - Construction of RSA-Based Authentication Scheme in Authorized Access to
      Healthcare Services : Authorized Access to Healthcare Services.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1471-6 [doi]
AB  - Modern network technology yields new interface for telecare medicine information 
      systems in short TMIS used for patient's healthcare. This system is used to
      provide healthcare services to patients at their home. It can be observed,
      telecare medicine information systems generally suffer several attacks as
      information being transmitted over a public network. Therefore, various
      authentication and key agreement schemes are proposed for TMIS to ensure secure
      and authorized patients communication over given public network. However, most of
      the schemes fail to achieve essential attributes discussed in this article.
      Although the key attributes of security and efficiency should be achieved in a
      common framework. This paper proposes construction of an RSA based authentication
      scheme for authorized access to healthcare services and achieves desirable key
      attributes of authentication protocols. Proof of security against polynomial time
      adversary is given in the random oracle to justify the security of proposed
      scheme. Communication analysis and computation analysis of proposed scheme
      indicates that proposed scheme's performance is comparable and having better
      security.

TI  - Patient Monitoring System Using Cognitive Internet of Things.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1095-2 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we ponder multi-user medical image transmission using Cognitive 
      Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) Multi-carrier Code-division-multiple-access
      (MC-CDMA) system to monitor patient information. We investigate the performance
      of such system in the communication layer and application layer of internet of
      things (IOT). Patient monitoring system plays vital role in the hospital
      particularly in the emergency ward to resolve certain problems such as
      maintaining glucose level in the body, maintaining minimum sugar levels under
      emergency conditions. IOT find tremendous application in the hospital to deal
      with certain issues such as injection of drug to the patients by doctor from
      remote places, monitoring patients heart beats, sugar level by the concerned
      doctors. MIMO finds many applications in medical field to enrich data rate while 
      communication patient information at faster rate. We utilize MC-CDMA system to
      accommodate large user patients information and to transmit such information with
      high resolution by eliminating channel impairments. We are utilizing Cognitive
      spectrum for medical image transmission of higher bandwidth applications. We
      realize Double-space-time transmit diversity as MIMO profile to boost up
      throughput. We perform multi-carrier modulation using IDFT at the transmitter .we
      carryout demodulation employing DFT at the hospital. We introduce Multi-carrier
      communication to fulfil the need of bandwidth efficiency and to diminish
      frequency selectivity effects.In the application layer, we estimate patient's
      information with aid of block-nulling decoding algorithm. Moreover we analyze the
      quality of image of D-STTD MC-CDMA system with turbo style of channel encoder to 
      manifest medical image with high resolution with less signal strength. We
      conclude that Cognitive D-STTD MC-CDMA system provides reliable communication for
      the application of IOT and also transfer high resolution medical image with less 
      signal strength in order to observe patient status by doctor.

TI  - Securing electronic medical record in Near Field Communication using Advanced
      Encryption Standard (AES).
PG  - 357-362
LID - 10.3233/THC-171140 [doi]
AB  - Doctors usually require patients' medical records before medical examinations.
      Nevertheless, obtaining such records may take time. Hence, Near Field
      Communication (NFC) could be used to store and send medical records between
      doctors and patients. Another issue is that there could be a threat such as, Man 
      In The Middle Attack and eavesdropping, thus, a security method is required to
      secure the data. Furthermore, the information regarding the key and
      initialisation vector in NFC cannot be sent using one data package, hence, the
      data transmission should be done several times. Therefore, the initialisation
      vector that changed in each transmission is implemented, and the key utilised is 
      based on the component agreed by both parties. This study aims at applying the
      cryptography process that does disturb and hinder the speed of data transmission.
      The result demonstrated that the data transmitted could be secured and the
      encryption process did not hinder data exchange. Also, different number of
      characters in plaintexts required different amount of time for encryption and
      decryption. It could be affected by the specifications of the devices used and
      the processes happening in the devices.

TI  - Achieving Efficient and Privacy-Preserving k-NN Query for Outsourced eHealthcare 
      Data.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1229-1 [doi]
AB  - The boom of Internet of Things devices promotes huge volumes of eHealthcare data 
      will be collected and aggregated at eHealthcare provider. With the help of these 
      health data, eHealthcare provider can offer reliable data service (e.g., k-NN
      query) to doctors for better diagnosis. However, the IT facility in the
      eHealthcare provider is incompetent with the huge volumes of eHealthcare data, so
      one popular solution is to deploy a powerful cloud and appoint the cloud to
      execute the k-NN query service. In this case, since the eHealthcare data are very
      sensitive yet cloud servers are not fully trusted, directly executing the k-NN
      query service in the cloud inevitably incurs privacy challenges. Apart from the
      privacy issues, efficiency issues also need to be taken into consideration
      because achieving privacy requirement will incur additional computational cost.
      However, existing focuses on k-NN query do not (fully) consider the data privacy 
      or are inefficient. For instance, the best computational complexity of k-NN query
      over encrypted eHealthcare data in the cloud is as large as [Formula: see text], 
      where N is the total number of data. In this paper, aiming at addressing the
      privacy and efficiency challenges, we design an efficient and privacy-preserving 
      k-NN query scheme for encrypted outsourced eHealthcare data. Our proposed scheme 
      is characterized by integrating the k d-tree with the homomorphic encryption
      technique for efficient storing encrypted data in the cloud and processing
      privacy-preserving k-NN query over encrypted data. Compared with existing works, 
      our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of privacy-preserving k-NN query. 
      Specifically, our proposed scheme can achieve k-NN computation over encrypted
      data with [Formula: see text] computational complexity, where l and N
      respectively denote the data dimension and the total number of data. In addition,
      detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is really
      privacy-preserving under our security model and performance evaluation also
      indicates that our proposed scheme is indeed efficient in terms of computational 
      cost.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Health Care Information Technologies: Evaluation of Trust,
      Security Beliefs, and Privacy as Determinants of Health Care Outcomes.
PG  - e107
LID - 10.2196/jmir.9014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diffusion of health information technologies (HITs) within the
      health care sector continues to grow. However, there is no theory explaining how 
      success of HITs influences patient care outcomes. With the increase in data
      breaches, HITs' success now hinges on the effectiveness of data protection
      solutions. Still, empirical research has only addressed privacy concerns, with
      little regard for other factors of information assurance. OBJECTIVE: The
      objective of this study was to study the effectiveness of HITs using the DeLone
      and McLean Information Systems Success Model (DMISSM). We examined the role of
      information assurance constructs (ie, the role of information security beliefs,
      privacy concerns, and trust in health information) as measures of HIT
      effectiveness. We also investigated the relationships between information
      assurance and three aspects of system success: attitude toward health information
      exchange (HIE), patient access to health records, and perceived patient care
      quality. METHODS: Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed the data from a
      sample of 3677 cancer patients from a public dataset. We used R software (R
      Project for Statistical Computing) and the Lavaan package to test the
      hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: Our extension of the DMISSM to health care
      was supported. We found that increased privacy concerns reduce the frequency of
      patient access to health records use, positive attitudes toward HIE, and
      perceptions of patient care quality. Also, belief in the effectiveness of
      information security increases the frequency of patient access to health records 
      and positive attitude toward HIE. Trust in health information had a positive
      association with attitudes toward HIE and perceived patient care quality. Trust
      in health information had no direct effect on patient access to health records;
      however, it had an indirect relationship through privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS:
      Trust in health information and belief in the effectiveness of information
      security safeguards increases perceptions of patient care quality. Privacy
      concerns reduce patients' frequency of accessing health records, patients'
      positive attitudes toward HIE exchange, and overall perceived patient care
      quality. Health care organizations are encouraged to implement security
      safeguards to increase trust, the frequency of health record use, and reduce
      privacy concerns, consequently increasing patient care quality.

TI  - Blockchain-Based Medical Records Secure Storage and Medical Service Framework.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1121-4 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and complete medical data are one valuable asset for patients. Privacy
      protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during
      medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records 
      has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain
      technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the
      characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain
      technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we
      design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and
      cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is
      described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are
      presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The
      proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no
      single party has absolute power to affect the processing.

      for Telecare Medical Information System.
PG  - 1749-1759
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2870319 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health systems, such as telecare medical information system (TMIS),
      allow patients to exchange their health information with a medical center/doctor 
      for diagnosis in real time, and across borders. Given the sensitive nature of
      health information/medical data, ensuring the security of such systems is
      crucial. In this paper, we revisit Das et al.'s authentication protocol, which is
      designed to ensure patient anonymity and untraceability. Then, we demonstrate
      that the security claims are invalid, by showing how both security features
      (i.e., patient anonymity and untraceability) can be compromised. We also
      demonstrate that the protocol suffers from smartcard launch attacks. To mitigate 
      such design flaws, we propose a new lightweight authentication protocol using the
      cryptographic hash function for TMIS. We then analyze the security of the
      proposed protocol using AVISPA and Scyther, two widely used formal specification 
      tools. The performance analysis demonstrates that our protocol is more efficient 
      than other competing protocols.

AB  - Medical interventions are becoming more complex day by day. Moreover, compared
      with the past, more healthcare professionals take part in the same intervention
      in the field of medicine. The use of technology in medical interventions has also
      increased. This change in the health sector brings together several legal
      discussions. In this study, the legal consequences that arise from the treatment 
      processes carried out by the residents and resident educators (registerers /
      attending physicians), the exchange of information between them, and the usage of
      some messaging platforms, especially WhatsApp, in this process will be analyzed.

TI  - Development of a Secure Cross-Institutional Data Collection System Based on
      Distributed Standardized EMR Storage.
PG  - 35-39
AB  - This paper describes a secure data collection infrastructure involving
      standardized electronic medical record (EMR) storage and Private Set
      Intersection, a secure data collection technology based on Bloom filter. The
      objective of this infrastructure is to facilitate rapid secondary use of exported
      EMR data in cross-patient or cross-institutional analyses based on the
      Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange (SS-MIX), Japan's domestic
      standard for EMR exporting. Design of the infrastructure and its underlying
      concepts are described herein. In an experimental test, an intersection operation
      involving approximately 1 million records was completed within a minute; this
      result is expected to be representative of the system in actual use. In
      forthcoming work, we plan to verify the system performance using larger data
      sets.

TI  - Design of a Secure Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for Smart Healthcare.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1251-3 [doi]
AB  - Now-a-days, the society is witnessing a keen urge to enhance the quality of
      healthcare services with the intervention of technology in the health sector. The
      main focus in transforming traditional healthcare to smart healthcare is on
      facilitating the patients as well as medical professionals. However, this
      changover is not easy due to various issues of security and integrity associated 
      with it. Security of patients's personal health record and privacy can be handled
      well by permitting only authorized access to the confidential health-data via
      suitably designed authentication scheme. In pursuit to contribute in this
      direction, we came across the role of Universal Serial Bus (USB), the most widely
      accepted interface, in enabling communication between peripheral devices and a
      host controller like laptop, personal computer, smart phone, tablet etc. In the
      process, we analysed a recently proposed a three-factor authentication scheme for
      consumer USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD) by He et al. In this paper, we
      demonstrate that He et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to leakage of temporary but
      session specific information attacks, late detection of message replay, forward
      secrecy attacks, and backward secrecy attacks. Then motivated with the benefits
      of USB, we propose a secure three-factor authentication scheme for smart
      healthcare.

TI  - Improving Speed and Security When Sharing Protected Health Information of
      Deceased Organ Donors.
PG  - 279-282
LID - 10.1177/1526924819855077 [doi]
AB  - Because extensive data from medical records are gathered by organ procurement
      teams, the process of data transfer between sites created a data security risk.
      This includes the use of fax machines, courier services, and employees' vehicles.
      Even health records transmitted over public Wi-Fi become at risk for a data
      breach. The Plan-Do-Study-Act method for performance improvement was used to
      address this time-consuming and labor-intensive process. A secured virtual
      private network from within the donor hospital site setting was developed to
      improve the transfer of images and data. The goal was to improve the process and 
      increase data security. Once the new network was in place, the process steps
      decreased and eliminated data vulnerability. Average process time decreased by
      approximately 1 hour. Organs procured increased from pre (expected 3, observed 2)
      to post (expected 3, observed 5) implementation of the new process.

TI  - The Effects of Public Concern for Information Privacy on the Adoption of Health
      Information Exchanges (HIEs) by Healthcare Entities.
PG  - 1202-1211
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2018.1471336 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) by healthcare
      organizations may not achieve the desired outcomes as consumers may request that 
      their health information remains unshared because of information privacy
      concerns. Drawing on the insights of concern for information privacy (CFIP)
      literature, this work extends the application of CFIP to the HIE domain. This
      study attempts to develop and test a model centered on the four dimensions of
      CFIP construct (collection, errors, unauthorized access, and secondary use) and
      their antecedents to predict consumers' opt-in behavioral intention toward HIE in
      the presence of the perceived health status' effects. We conducted an online
      survey in the United States using 826 samples. The results demonstrate that the
      perceived health information sensitivity and computer anxiety meaningfully
      contribute to information privacy concerns and CFIP construct significantly
      impedes consumers' opt-in decision to HIEs. Interestingly, contrary to our
      expectation, perceived poor health status considerably attenuates the negative
      effects exerted by CFIP on opt-in intention. The model proposed by this study can
      be used as a useful conceptual tool by both further studies and practitioners to 
      examine the complex nature of patients' reactions to information privacy threats 
      associated with the use of HIE technology in the healthcare industry.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a national Personal Health Record (PHR) infrastructure was
      supposed to have been introduced in Germany by law in 2006 and different
      providers are entering the market, no system has yet been widely adopted in
      Germany. There is also little information available on how current technical
      advancements affect German patients' and physicians' trust in PHR systems.
      METHODS: Supporting scenarios obtained from clinicians, this study proposes a
      concept for a German PHR system using a public cloud infrastructure, smartphone
      access and focusing on trust, privacy, and interoperability. In advance to an
      eventual implementation, a multi-center questionnaire study has been conducted to
      predict patients' and physicians' intention to use that system and evaluate their
      trust in different providers of such a system. RESULTS: Our results show that
      both patients and physicians are highly likely to use the PHR based on the
      present concept. Trust in healthcare providers exceeds trust in other
      institutions like private companies, health insurance companies, or even
      governmental institutions when offering such a PHR system. CONCLUSIONS: We
      recommend the implementation of this PHR system. To maximize patients' and
      physicians' trust in the system, it should be offered to patients by their
      healthcare provider. Further evaluation regarding its actual adoption and
      expected improvement in patient outcome based on the scenarios is advisable.

TI  - Hospital adoption of multiple health information exchange approaches and
      information accessibility.
PG  - 577-583
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hospital engagement in electronic health information exchange (HIE)
      has increased over recent years. We aimed to 1) determine the change in adoption 
      of 3 types of information exchange: secure messaging, provider portals, and use
      of an HIE; and 2) to assess if growth in each approach corresponded to increased 
      ability to access and integrate patient information from outside providers.
      METHODS: Panel analysis of all nonfederal, acute care hospitals in the United
      States using hospital- and year-fixed effects. The sample consisted of 1917
      hospitals that responded to the American Hospital Association Information
      Technology Supplement every year from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS: Adoption of each
      approach increased by 9-15 percentage points over the study period. The average
      number of HIE approaches used by each hospital increased from 1.0 to 1.4.
      Adoption of each approach was associated with increased likelihood that providers
      routinely had necessary outside information of 4.2-12.7 percentage points and
      4.5-13.3 percentage points increase in information integration. Secure messaging 
      was associated with the largest increase in both. Adoption of 1 approach
      increased the likelihood of having outside information by 10.3 percentage points,
      while adopting a second approach further increased the likelihood by 9.5
      percentage points. Trends in number of approaches and integration were similar.
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: No single HIE tool provided high levels of usable,
      integrated health information. Instead, hospitals benefited from adopting
      multiple tools. Policy initiatives that reduce the complexity of enabling high
      value HIE could result in broader adoption of HIE and use of information to
      inform care.

TI  - Development of a gateway for interoperability in community-based care: An
      empirical study.
PG  - 57-67
LID - 10.3233/THC-170841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information and communications technology has attracted attention as 
      a useful way of sharing care records in community-based care. Such information
      sharing systems, however, imposed the burden of inputting the same records into
      different information systems due to a lack of interoperability of the systems.
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a gateway that links
      information systems and to investigate the functionality and usability of the
      gateway through an empirical study. METHODS: We developed a gateway with
      healthcare and welfare professionals in Kashiwa city, Japan. The gateway system
      consisted of two sub-systems: a data exchange sub-system and a common sub-system.
      Regarding the security, we used the transport layer security 1.2 and a public key
      infrastructure. For document formats, we utilized the health level seven
      international, extensible markup language, and portable document format. In
      addition, we performed an empirical study with 11 scenarios of four simulated
      patients and a questionnaire survey to the professionals. RESULTS: Professionals 
      of eight occupations participated the empirical study and verified the gateway to
      link information systems of six vendors. For a questionnaire survey, 32
      professionals out of 40 reported that the gateway would eliminate the burden of
      inputting the same records into different information systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) enables
      physicians to efficiently and conveniently make certain diagnoses and medical
      treatment for patients over the insecure public Internet. To ensure patients
      securely access to medicinal services, many authentication schemes have been
      proposed. Although numerous cryptographic authentication schemes for TMIS have
      been proposed with the aim to ensure data security, user privacy and
      authentication, various forms of attacks make these schemes impractical. METHODS:
      To design a truly secure and practical authentication scheme for TMIS, a new
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS
      without sharing the system private key with distributed servers is presented in
      this work. RESULTS: Our proposed protocol has perfect security features including
      mutual authentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and resisting
      various well-known attacks, and these security feathers are confirmed by the BAN 
      logic and heuristic cryptanalysis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A secure
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS is
      presented in this work, which has perfect security properties including perfect
      forward secrecy, supporting user anonymity, etc., and can withstand various
      attacks such as impersonation attack, off-line password guessing attack, etc..
      Considering security is the most important factor for an authentication scheme,
      so our scheme is more suitable for multi-server TMIS.
