AB  - Within the framework of a broader e-health strategy launched a decade ago, in
      2015 Switzerland passed a new federal law on patients' electronic health records 
      (EHR). The reform requires hospitals to adopt interoperable EHRs to facilitate
      data sharing and cooperation among healthcare providers, ultimately contributing 
      to improvements in quality of care and efficiency in the health system. Adoption 
      is voluntary for ambulatories and private practices, that may however be pushed
      towards EHRs by patients. The latter have complete discretion in the choice of
      the health information to share. Moreover, careful attention is given to data
      security issues. Despite good intentions, the high institutional and
      organisational fragmentation of the Swiss healthcare system, as well as the lack 
      of full agreement with stakeholders on some critical points of the reform, slowed
      the process of adoption of the law. In particular, pilot projects made clear that
      the participation of ambulatories is doomed to be low unless appropriate
      incentives are put in place. Moreover, most stakeholders point at the strategy
      proposed to finance technical implementation and management of EHRs as a major
      drawback. After two years of intense preparatory work, the law entered into force
      in April 2017.

AB  - The US healthcare system is moving into a new era of value-based care, which
      focuses on delivering safer and higher quality care while reducing costs. Health 
      information exchange (HIE) has been a vital component in this process; however,
      there has been a lack of awareness and use of HIE among nurse leaders,
      clinicians, and researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide nurses and
      administrators with a brief overview of HIE and its impact on care delivery, as
      well as practical applications using specific case examples.

TI  - Exchanging Appointment Data Among Healthcare Institutions.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - The introduction of national electronic patient records such as the electronic
      patient dossier EPD in Switzerland provides a new basis for digitizing healthcare
      processes at a national level. One process however, that is currently neglected
      within the Swiss EPD, is the scheduling process in healthcare. The objective of
      this work is to analyze the appointment scheduling process and the involved IT
      systems in order to develop an appointment data structure and a concept for
      cross-institutional exchange of appointment data. The analysis showed that
      various outpatient and inpatient information systems support appointment booking 
      through proprietary solutions. A true standard for appointment data exchange is
      missing. We suggest an appointment data structure and a corresponding data
      exchange process based on the FHIR standard. In its current implementation, the
      Swiss EPD does not support this proposed appointment scheduling process. We
      discuss how potential additions such as the IHE Care Services Discovery (CSD)
      profile can provide better compatibility.

TI  - A Statewide Medication Management System: Health Information Exchange to Support 
      Drug Therapy Optimization by Pharmacists across the Continuum of Care.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1055/s-0037-1620262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While evidence generally supports the use of medication management
      technology, systems are typically implemented and evaluated piecemeal rather than
      as part of a comprehensive model for medication management. Systems to support
      drug therapy optimization, increasingly a key role of pharmacists in our
      healthcare system, have not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to
      describe the design, implementation, and use of health information technology to 
      support the hospital and community pharmacists' management of medications for
      high-risk patients statewide in the "Pharm2Pharm" model of care. Our aims were to
      make it easier for the pharmacists to access information needed to identify and
      resolve drug therapy problems using best practices for medication management and 
      communicate with other members of the care team. METHODS: The pharmacist's roles 
      and the medication management processes guided the design of the supporting
      technology, which was implemented after the Pharm2Pharm model was launched and
      the pharmacists' technology needs were assessed. Priorities for technology
      included sending care transition documents from hospital to community pharmacist 
      securely and efficiently, access to medical records, including medications and
      laboratory results, documentation, and patient tracking. Implementation and use
      of the technology were documented. RESULTS: Communications, medication
      management, and population management solutions were implemented to support the
      Pharm2Pharm model. The pharmacists delivering services through this model adopted
      and meaningfully used this technology to support their work. CONCLUSION:
      Implementing technology with value outside of the Pharm2Pharm model was a
      strategic approach to investment. This work emphasizes the importance of shifting
      the focus of technology from supporting a specific piece of the medication
      management process to supporting the goal of optimizing medication regimens.
      Health information exchange systems can provide important technology needed to
      integrate pharmacists into care teams as they are deployed to improve patient
      outcomes.

TI  - Health systems' use of enterprise health information exchange vs single
      electronic health record vendor environments and unplanned readmissions.
PG  - 989-998
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz116 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enterprise health information exchange (HIE) and a single electronic
      health record (EHR) vendor solution are 2 information exchange approaches to
      improve performance and increase the quality of care. This study sought to
      determine the association between adoption of enterprise HIE vs a single vendor
      environment and changes in unplanned readmissions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      association between unplanned 30-day readmissions among adult patients and
      adoption of enterprise HIE or a single vendor environment was measured in a panel
      of 211 system-member hospitals from 2010 through 2014 using fixed-effects
      regression models. Sample hospitals were members of health systems in 7 states.
      Enterprise HIE was defined as self-reported ability to exchange information with 
      other members of the same health system who used different EHR vendors. A single 
      EHR vendor environment reported exchanging information with other health system
      members, but all using the same EHR vendor. RESULTS: Enterprise HIE adoption was 
      more common among the study sample than EHR (75% vs 24%). However, adoption of a 
      single EHR vendor environment was associated with a 0.8% reduction in the
      probability of a readmission within 30 days of discharge. The estimated impact of
      adopting an enterprise HIE strategy on readmissions was smaller and not
      statically significant. CONCLUSION: Reductions in the probability of an unplanned
      readmission after a hospital adopts a single vendor environment suggests that HIE
      technologies can better support the aim of higher quality care. Additionally,
      health systems may benefit more from a single vendor environment approach than
      attempting to foster exchange across multiple EHR vendors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A mobile application for personal health records (PHR) 
      would allow patients to access their clinical data easily. When PHR connects with
      multiple electronic health records (EHRs), doctors and patients can exchange
      large quantities of patient data from the EHR (e.g., medication list, diagnoses, 
      allergies, and laboratory data). Furthermore, personal daily records can also be 
      retrieved from PHR (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, dietary habits, and exercise).
      However, no standard interoperability between EHRs and PHR has been established. 
      This study aims to convert clinical data in EHRs into the Health Level Seven
      (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data format while
      developing a PHR application to present the FHIR data. METHODS: In Japan,
      Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange version 2 (SS-MIX2) is
      typically utilized as a health information exchange to preserve and elicit
      clinical data from EHRs. We converted clinical data in the SS-MIX2 storage at
      Tohoku University Hospital into the FHIR repository server using the R4 standard.
      Additionally, we used the Swift programming language to build a PHR application. 
      RESULTS: We converted patients' basic information, disease names, diagnostic
      reports, prescriptions, and injection data from the SS-MIX2 to the FHIR server.
      Besides, we launched a PHR application that could retrieve data from the FHIR
      server to display patients' clinical information. CONCLUSIONS: Our work
      demonstrated the conversion of SS-MIX2 data into the FHIR and presented them with
      our PHR application. This mechanism may be useful to accelerate the sharing of
      clinical information among doctors and patients.

AB  - Heterogeneities in data representation and care processes create interoperability
      complexity among Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs). We can resolve such
      data and process level heterogeneities by following consistent healthcare
      standards like Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), OpenEHR, and HL7 FHIR.
      However, these standards also differ at the structural and implementation level, 
      making interoperability more complex. Hence, there is a need to investigate
      mechanisms that can resolve data level heterogeneity to achieve semantic data
      interoperability between heterogeneous systems. As a solution to this, we offer
      an architecture that utilizes a resource server based on GraphQL and HL7 FHIR
      that establishes communication between two heterogeneous EHRs. This paper
      describes how the proposed architecture is implemented to achieve
      interoperability between two heterogeneous EHRs, HL7 FHIR and OpenMRS. The
      presented approach establishes secure communication between the EHRs and provides
      accurate mappings that enable timely health information exchange between EHRs.

TI  - The effects of data entry structure on patients' perceptions of information
      quality in Health Information Exchange (HIE).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To exchange patient health information using Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) projects, such information first should be collected
      thoroughly using an appropriate data entry interface that reinforces information 
      quality (IQ). Assessment of the given data interface based on its structure level
      may give us a better understanding of patients' attitudes toward
      information-sharing efforts. The main objective of this study is to examine the
      effects of data structure on perceptions and attitudes of patients toward the
      quality of health information that may be shared through HIE networks. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Eight experiments were conducted to examine the impact of different 
      design of information collection interfaces (structured vs. unstructured) to
      record two types of health information (sensitive vs. non-sensitive) that can be 
      used for two types of sharing purposes (health care vs. marketing). RESULTS:
      Results show that the degree of data entry structure can significantly influence 
      patients' perceptions of completeness, accuracy, psychological risk,
      accessibility of data, concise representation, and understandability of health
      information. DISCUSSION: There is a connection between data entry interface
      design and patients' perceptions of the quality of health information used in HIE
      networks, which in turn, could lead to the development of best practices in
      interface design and data collection techniques. This may also improve
      interactions between patients and healthcare entities, enhance patients'
      attitudes toward data collection procedures and HIE, and help healthcare
      providers use complete and accurate databases. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that
      healthcare professionals can tailor data entry interfaces based on the
      sensitivity of medical data and the purpose of information exchange.

TI  - Perspectives of Patients, Health Care Professionals, and Developers Toward
      Blockchain-Based Health Information Exchange: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e18582
LID - 10.2196/18582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the electronic health record system adoption rate has
      reached 96% in the United States, implementation and usage of health information 
      exchange (HIE) is still lagging behind. Blockchain has come into the spotlight as
      a technology to solve this problem. However, there have been no studies assessing
      the perspectives of different stakeholders regarding blockchain-based
      patient-centered HIE. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the
      awareness among patients, health care professionals, and information technology
      developers toward blockchain-based HIE, and compare their different perspectives 
      related to the platform using a qualitative research methodology. METHODS: In
      this qualitative study, we applied grounded theory and the Promoting Action on
      Research Implementation in the Health Service (PARiHS) framework. We interviewed 
      7 patients, 7 physicians, and 7 developers, for a total of 21 interviewees.
      RESULTS: Regarding the leakage of health information, the patient group did not
      have concerns in contrast to the physician and developer groups. Physicians were 
      particularly concerned about the fact that errors in the data cannot be easily
      fixed due to the nature of blockchain technology. Patients were not against the
      idea of providing information for clinical trials or research institutions. They 
      wished to be provided with the results of clinical research rather than being
      compensated for providing data. The developers emphasized that blockchain must be
      technically mature before it can be applied to the health care scene, and
      standards of medical information to be exchanged must first be established.
      CONCLUSIONS: The three groups' perceptions of blockchain were generally positive 
      about the idea of patients having the control of sharing their own health
      information. However, they were skeptical about the cooperation among various
      institutions and implementation for data standardization in the establishment
      process, in addition to how the service will be employed in practice. Taking
      these factors into consideration during planning, development, and operation of a
      platform will contribute to establishing practical treatment plans and tracking
      in a more convenient manner for both patients and physicians. Furthermore, it
      will help expand the related research and health management industry based on
      blockchain.

TI  - Generalizable Layered Blockchain Architecture for Health Care Applications:
      Development, Case Studies, and Evaluation.
PG  - e19029
LID - 10.2196/19029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data coordination across multiple health care facilities has become
      increasingly important for many emerging health care applications. Distrust has
      been recognized as a key barrier to the success of such applications. Leveraging 
      blockchain technology could provide potential solutions tobuild trust between
      data providers and receivers by taking advantage of blockchain properties such as
      security, immutability, anonymity, decentralization, and smart contracts. Many
      health technologies have empirically proven that blockchain designs fit well with
      the needs of health care applications with certain degrees of success. However,
      there is a lack of robust architecture to provide a practical framework for
      developers to implement applications and test the performance of stability,
      efficiency, and scalability using standard blockchain designs. A generalized
      blockchain model is needed for the health care community to adopt blockchain
      technology and develop applications in a timely fashion. OBJECTIVE: This study
      aimed at building a generalized blockchain architecture that provides data
      coordination functions, including data requests, permission granting, data
      exchange, and usage tracking, for a wide spectrum of health care application
      developments. METHODS: An augmented, 3-layered blockchain architecture was built 
      on a private blockchain network. The 3 layers, from bottom to top, are as
      follows: (1) incorporation of fundamental blockchain settings and smart contract 
      design for data collection; (2) interactions between the blockchain and health
      care application development environment using Node.js and web3.js; and (3) a
      flexible development platform that supports web technologies such as HTML, https,
      and various programing languages. Two example applications, health information
      exchange (HIE) and clinical trial recruitment, were developed in our design to
      demonstrate the feasibility of the layered architecture. Case studies were
      conducted to test the performance in terms of stability, efficiency, and
      scalability of the blockchain system. RESULTS: A total of 331,142 simulated HIE
      requests from accounts of 40,000 patients were successfully validated through
      this layered blockchain architecture with an average exchange time of 11.271 (SD 
      2.208) seconds. We also simulated a clinical trial recruitment scenario with the 
      same set of patients and various recruitment criteria to match potential subjects
      using the same architecture. Potential subjects successfully received the
      clinical trial recruitment information and granted permission to the trial
      sponsors to access their health records with an average time of 3.07 seconds.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a generalized layered blockchain architecture
      that offers health technology community blockchain features for application
      development without requiring developers to have extensive experience with
      blockchain technology. The case studies tested the performance of our design and 
      empirically proved the feasibility of the architecture in 2 relevant health
      application domains.

TI  - A Secure Protocol for Managing and Sharing Personal Healthcare Data.
PG  - 92-96
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200701 [doi]
AB  - Current technologies provide the ability to healthcare practitioners and
      citizens, to share and analyse healthcare information, thus improving the patient
      care quality. Nevertheless, European Union (EU) citizens have very limited
      control over their own health data, despite that several countries are using
      national or regional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for realizing virtual or
      centralized national repositories of citizens' health records. Health Information
      Exchange (HIE) can greatly improve the completeness of patients' records.
      However, most of the current researches deal with exchanging health information
      among healthcare organizations, without giving the ability to the citizens on
      accessing, managing or exchanging healthcare data with healthcare organizations
      and thus being able to handle their own data, mainly due to lack of
      standardization and security protocols. Towards this challenge, in this paper a
      secure Device-to-Device (D2D) protocol is specified that can be used by software 
      applications, aiming on facilitating the exchange of health data among citizens
      and healthcare professionals, on top of Bluetooth technologies.

TI  - Implementing Prudent Healthcare in the NHS in Wales; what are the barriers and
      enablers for clinicians?
PG  - 104-110
LID - 10.1111/jep.13023 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Prudent Healthcare is a strategy adopted by the Welsh Government in
      response to the challenge of improving health care during times of austerity and 
      when needs and demand are rising. Four principles underlie Prudent Healthcare: to
      achieve health and wellbeing through co production; care for those with the
      greatest health needs first; do only what is needed; and reduce inappropriate
      variation. For Prudent Healthcare to be implemented in Wales, it is necessary for
      health professionals to adopt these principles in practice. OBJECTIVE: This paper
      reports a qualitative evaluation of clinicians' awareness, experiences, and views
      about Prudent Healthcare, identifying barriers and enablers to implementation
      from the clinician's perspective. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 28)
      and five focus groups (with 23 participants) were undertaken with a diverse range
      of health professionals working in primary and secondary care. Analysis was
      underpinned by the COM-B model which provides a framework to understand behaviour
      change in context using three domains, Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation.
      RESULTS: Clinicians reported the importance and challenges of accessing and
      sharing information and evidence to inform practice (Capability). Reduced
      staffing levels and service availability were highlighted as possible barriers to
      Prudent Healthcare implementation while multidisciplinary working and
      reorganization of staff roles and services were considered enablers
      (Opportunity). Finally, although the principles of Prudent Healthcare were
      broadly welcomed (Motivation), a lack of awareness of the initiative and the
      management of patient expectations presented barriers. CONCLUSION: While there
      was a positive response and widespread support for the principles of Prudent
      Healthcare by clinicians, increasing awareness of the initiative and improvement 
      to systems to enable information sharing and the monitoring of patient outcomes
      could improve the consistency of implementation.

TI  - Identification of Patients in Need of Advanced Care for Depression Using Data
      Extracted From a Statewide Health Information Exchange: A Machine Learning
      Approach.
PG  - e13809
LID - 10.2196/13809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the most commonly occurring form of mental illness worldwide,
      depression poses significant health and economic burdens to both the individual
      and community. Different types of depression pose different levels of risk.
      Individuals who suffer from mild forms of depression may recover without any
      assistance or be effectively managed by primary care or family practitioners.
      However, other forms of depression are far more severe and require advanced care 
      by certified mental health providers. However, identifying cases of depression
      that require advanced care may be challenging to primary care providers and
      health care team members whose skill sets run broad rather than deep. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to leverage a comprehensive range of patient-level diagnostic,
      behavioral, and demographic data, as well as past visit history data from a
      statewide health information exchange to build decision models capable of
      predicting the need of advanced care for depression across patients presenting at
      Eskenazi Health, the public safety net health system for Marion County,
      Indianapolis, Indiana. METHODS: Patient-level diagnostic, behavioral,
      demographic, and past visit history data extracted from structured datasets were 
      merged with outcome variables extracted from unstructured free-text datasets and 
      were used to train random forest decision models that predicted the need of
      advanced care for depression across (1) the overall patient population and (2)
      various subsets of patients at higher risk for depression-related adverse events;
      patients with a past diagnosis of depression; patients with a Charlson
      comorbidity index of >/=1; patients with a Charlson comorbidity index of >/=2;
      and all unique patients identified across the 3 above-mentioned high-risk groups.
      RESULTS: The overall patient population consisted of 84,317 adult (aged >/=18
      years) patients. A total of 6992 (8.29%) of these patients were in need of
      advanced care for depression. Decision models for high-risk patient groups
      yielded area under the curve (AUC) scores between 86.31% and 94.43%. The decision
      model for the overall patient population yielded a comparatively lower AUC score 
      of 78.87%. The variance of optimal sensitivity and specificity for all decision
      models, as identified using Youden J Index, is as follows: sensitivity=68.79% to 
      83.91% and specificity=76.03% to 92.18%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the
      ability to automate screening for patients in need of advanced care for
      depression across (1) an overall patient population or (2) various high-risk
      patient groups using structured datasets covering acute and chronic conditions,
      patient demographics, behaviors, and past visit history. Furthermore, these
      results show considerable potential to enable preventative care and can be easily
      integrated into existing clinical workflows to improve access to wraparound
      health care services.

TI  - An International Perspective on Health Information Exchange: Adoption in OECD
      Countries With Different Health Care System Configurations.
PG  - 299-311
LID - 10.1177/1077558719858245 [doi]
AB  - The sharing of information among various care providers is becoming an essential 
      feature of health care systems, and many countries are now adopting policies to
      foster health information exchange, defined as the electronic transfer of data or
      information among health care organizations involved in the delivery of care.
      Given the increasing adoption of this type of policy in several Organization for 
      Economic Cooperation and Development countries, it is important to compare
      experiences from different countries, because policy adoption in one country can 
      be explained more comprehensively and coherently through comparison with similar 
      policies adopted in other nations. To make a more meaningful cross-country
      comparison, this article identifies a taxonomy of health systems, and it analyzes
      institutional and resource-based factors related to health information exchange
      adoption and how they differ in three main types of health systems: the National 
      Health Service, social health insurance, and private health insurance.

TI  - Human-centered development of an electronic health record-embedded, interactive
      information visualization in the emergency department using fast healthcare
      interoperability resources.
PG  - 1401-1410
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate an interactive information visualization embedded
      within the electronic health record (EHR) by following human-centered design
      (HCD) processes and leveraging modern health information exchange standards.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied an HCD process to develop a Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application that displays a patient's asthma
      history to clinicians in a pediatric emergency department. We performed a
      preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number
      of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction,
      and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality 
      were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end
      users. RESULTS: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated
      a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P < .001), number of
      screens (P < .001), and cognitive load (P < .001) for clinicians when compared to
      base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable
      functionality and high user satisfaction. DISCUSSION: Following HCD processes to 
      develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement 
      is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges
      associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as
      currently implemented. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our
      visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of
      pediatric asthma patients. Application development efforts in an operational
      context should leverage existing health information exchange standards, such as
      FHIR, and evidence-based mixed methods approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the
      greater need for information generated by bundled payment reimbursement and the
      use of Health Information Exchange (HIE). METHODS: The study is based on a
      secondary data analysis using theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) Healthcare
      IT Database and the AHA Annual Survey. A logistic regression was used to test the
      likelihood of hospitals participating in HIE if they were involved in bundled
      payment reimbursement. Negative binomial, ordered logistic and Poisson regression
      models were used to determine the associations between bundled payment
      reimbursement and health information sharing in terms of breadth, volume, and
      diversity, respectively. RESULTS: Hospitals in bundled payment programs were more
      likely to send and receive information through HIE and tosend information to
      different types of health providers but not to receive. They were also more
      likely to exchange different types of health information and to use HIE more
      often. CONCLUSIONS: The greater need for collaboration of hospitals participating
      in bundled payment programs was associated with greater information sharing among
      organizations through HIE, but different providers involved in the episode of
      care play different roles in HIE.

      there is a growing demand for healthcare, however, this demand is yet to be
      achieved due to the challenge in the limitation of resources and the complexity
      of the problem area.

TI  - The (Re)-Relaunching of the DMP, the French Shared Medical Record: New Features
      to Improve Uptake and Use.
PG  - 256-260
AB  - Health care delivery for patients with chronic conditions is complex and
      confusing. Care is often fragmented, less effective, and sometimes harmful. Given
      the potential for EHRs and other health IT systems to facilitate information flow
      between providers, patients, and settings, health IT-based measures are of
      particular interest for care coordination. Health information exchange (HIE) has 
      the potential to improve the quality of healthcare by enabling providers with
      better access to patient information from multiple sources at the point of care. 
      However, many barriers to HIE use have been reported. Another solution relies on 
      the implementation of a nationwide centralized framework of clinical information 
      sharing with "new" secure online care records stored in specifically created
      platforms. The French DMP follows this model but the adoption of the tool has
      been historically poor. In 2016, a renovation of the DMP program was launched in 
      nine pilot French departments and new features have been implemented: the DMP
      content has been fully specified, patients can create their DMP by themselves,
      DMPs are automatically filled in by data claims, a mobile app has been developed,
      and technical issues about DMP and EHRs interoperability have been resolved. In
      October 2017, over 900,000 people have a DMP with an average new DMP being
      created every minute. These results have to be confirmed in 2018 when the new DMP
      will be deployed on the whole French territory.
