AB  - Accurate and timely transmission of medical records between skilled nursing
      facilities and acute care settings has been logistically problematic. Often
      people are sent to the hospital with a packet of paper records, which is easily
      misplaced. The COVID-19 pandemic has further magnified this problem by the
      possibility of viral transmission via fomites. To protect themselves, staff and
      providers were donning personal protective equipment to review paper records,
      which was time-consuming and wasteful. We describe an innovative process
      developed by a team of hospital leadership, members of a local collaborative of
      skilled nursing facilities, and leadership of this collaborative group, to
      address this problem. Many possible solutions were suggested and reviewed. We
      describe the reasons for selecting our final document transfer process and how it
      was implemented. The critical success factors are also delineated. Other health
      systems and collaborative groups of skilled nursing facilities may benefit from
      implementing similar processes.

TI  - A novel tool for patient data management in the ICU-Ensuring timely and accurate 
      vital data exchange among ICU team members.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need to simplify data
      collection for critically-ill patients, particularly for physicians relocated to 
      the ICU setting. Herein we present a simple, reproducible, and
      highly-customizable manual-entry tool to track ICU patients using new
      HIPAA-compliant Google Big Query technology for parsing large datasets. This
      innovative flow chart is useful and could be modified to serve the particular
      needs of different sub-specialists, particularly those that either rely heavily
      on hand-written notes or experience poor electronic medical record (EMR)
      penetration. METHODS: The tool was developed using a combination of three Google 
      Enterprise features: Google Forms for data input, Google Sheets for data output, 
      and Google Big Query for data parsing. Code was written in SQL. Sheets functions 
      were used to transpose and filter parsed data. White and black box tests were
      performed to examine functionality. RESULTS: Our tool was successfully able to
      collect and output fictional patient data across all 57 data points specified by 
      the intensivists and surgeons of Cardiovascular Department of Mt. Sinai
      Morningside Hospital. CONCLUSION: The functional tests performed demonstrate use 
      of the tool. Though originally conceived to simplify patient data collection for 
      newly relocated physicians to the ICU, our tool also overcomes financial and
      technological barriers previously described in low-income countries that could
      dramatically improve patient care and provide data to power future studies in
      these regions. With the original code provided, implementers may adapt our tool
      to best meet the requirements of their clinical setting and protocols during this
      very challenging time.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 infection poses serious challenges to the
      healthcare system that are being addressed through the creation of new unique and
      advanced systems of care with disjointed care processes (eg, telehealth
      screening, drive-through specimen collection, remote testing, telehealth
      management). However, our current regulations on the flows of information for
      clinical care and research are antiquated and often conflict at the state and
      federal levels. We discuss proposed changes to privacy regulations such as the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act designed to let health
      information seamlessly and frictionlessly flow among the health entities that
      need to collaborate on treatment of patients and, also, allow it to flow to
      researchers trying to understand how to limit its impacts.

TI  - Social media as a tool for scientific updating at the time of COVID pandemic:
      Results from a national survey in Italy.
PG  - e0238414
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0238414 [doi]
AB  - In the face of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
      professionals on the frontline are in urgent need of frequent updates in the
      accomplishment of their practice. Hence, clinicians started to search for prompt,
      valid information on sources that are parallel to academic journals. Aim of this 
      work is to investigate the extent of this phenomenon. We administered an
      anonymous online cross-sectional survey to 645 Italian clinicians. Target of the 
      survey were all medical figures potentially involved in the management of
      COVID-19 cases. 369 questionnaires were returned. 19.5% (n = 72) of respondents
      were younger than 30 years-old; 49,3% (n = 182) worked in Infectious Diseases,
      Internal Medicine or Respiratory Medicine departments, 11.5% (n = 42) in
      Intensive Care Unit and 7.4% (n = 27) were general practitioner. 70% (n = 261) of
      respondents reported that their use of social media to seek medical information
      increased during the pandemic. 39.3% (n = 145) consistently consulted Facebook
      groups and 53.1% (n = 196) Whatsapp chats. 47% (n = 174) of respondents reported 
      that information shared on social media had a consistent impact on their daily
      practice. In the present study, we found no difference in social media usage
      between age groups or medical specialties. Given the urgent need for scientific
      update during the present pandemic, these findings may help understanding how
      clinicians access new evidences and implement them in their daily practice.

TI  - Predicting COVID-19-Related Health Care Resource Utilization Across a Statewide
      Patient Population: Model Development Study.
PG  - e31337
LID - 10.2196/31337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inability of health systems
      to leverage existing system infrastructure in order to rapidly develop and apply 
      broad analytical tools that could inform state- and national-level policymaking, 
      as well as patient care delivery in hospital settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has 
      also led to highlighted systemic disparities in health outcomes and access to
      care based on race or ethnicity, gender, income-level, and urban-rural divide.
      Although the United States seems to be recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic
      owing to widespread vaccination efforts and increased public awareness, there is 
      an urgent need to address the aforementioned challenges. OBJECTIVE: This study
      aims to inform the feasibility of leveraging broad, statewide datasets for
      population health-driven decision-making by developing robust analytical models
      that predict COVID-19-related health care resource utilization across patients
      served by Indiana's statewide Health Information Exchange. METHODS: We leveraged 
      comprehensive datasets obtained from the Indiana Network for Patient Care to
      train decision forest-based models that can predict patient-level need of health 
      care resource utilization. To assess these models for potential biases, we tested
      model performance against subpopulations stratified by age, race or ethnicity,
      gender, and residence (urban vs rural). RESULTS: For model development, we
      identified a cohort of 96,026 patients from across 957 zip codes in Indiana,
      United States. We trained the decision models that predicted health care resource
      utilization by using approximately 100 of the most impactful features from a
      total of 1172 features created. Each model and stratified subpopulation under
      test reported precision scores >70%, accuracy and area under the receiver
      operating curve scores >80%, and sensitivity scores approximately >90%. We noted 
      statistically significant variations in model performance across stratified
      subpopulations identified by age, race or ethnicity, gender, and residence (urban
      vs rural). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the possibility of developing
      decision models capable of predicting patient-level health care resource
      utilization across a broad, statewide region with considerable predictive
      performance. However, our models present statistically significant variations in 
      performance across stratified subpopulations of interest. Further efforts are
      necessary to identify root causes of these biases and to rectify them.

AB  - Understanding sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory risk factors
      in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is critically important, and requires
      building large and diverse COVID-19 cohorts with both retrospective information
      and prospective follow-up. A large Health Information Exchange (HIE) in Southeast
      Texas, which assembles and shares electronic health information among providers
      to facilitate patient care, was leveraged to identify COVID-19 patients, create a
      cohort, and identify risk factors for both favorable and unfavorable outcomes.
      The initial sample consists of 8,874 COVID-19 patients ascertained from the
      pandemic's onset to June 12th, 2020 and was created for the analyses shown here. 
      We gathered demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical data from patient's 
      encounters across the healthcare system. Tobacco use history was examined as a
      potential risk factor for COVID-19 fatality along with age, gender,
      race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. Of the 8,874 
      patients included in the cohort, 475 died from COVID-19. Of the 5,356 patients
      who had information on history of tobacco use, over 26% were current or former
      tobacco users. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of COVID-19
      fatality increased among those who were older (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06,
      1.08), male (1.91, 95% CI 1.58, 2.31), and had a history of tobacco use (2.45,
      95% CI 1.93, 3.11). History of tobacco use remained significantly associated
      (1.65, 95% CI 1.27, 2.13) with COVID-19 fatality after adjusting for age, gender,
      and race/ethnicity. This effort demonstrates the impact of having an HIE to
      rapidly identify a cohort, aggregate sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and
      laboratory data across disparate healthcare providers electronic health record
      (HER) systems, and follow the cohort over time. These HIE capabilities enable
      clinical specialists and epidemiologists to conduct outcomes analyses during the 
      current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Tobacco use appears to be an important risk
      factor for COVID-19 related death.

      Organization.
PG  - 13-16
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1726480 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: On December 16, 2020 representatives of the International Medical
      Informatics Association (IMIA), a Non-Governmental Organization in official
      relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), along with its International 
      Academy for Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI), held an open dialogue with WHO
      Director General (WHO DG) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus about the opportunities and 
      challenges of digital health during the COVID-19 global pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The
      aim of this paper is to report the outcomes of the dialogue and discussions with 
      more than 200 participants representing different civil society organizations
      (CSOs). METHODS: The dialogue was held in form of a webinar. After an initial
      address of the WHO DG, short presentations by the panelists, and live discussions
      between panelists, the WHO DG and WHO representatives took place. The audience
      was able to post questions in written. These written discussions were saved with 
      participants' consent and summarized in this paper. RESULTS: The main themes that
      were brought up by the audience for discussion were: (a) opportunities and
      challenges in general; (b) ethics and artificial intelligence; (c) digital
      divide; (d) education. Proposed actions included the development of a roadmap
      based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Decision
      making by policy makers needs to be evidence-based and health informatics
      research should be used to support decisions surrounding digital health, and we
      further propose next steps in the collaboration between IMIA and WHO such as
      future engagement in the World Health Assembly.

      Infrastructure: Exploring Hospitals' Challenges with Data Exchange.
PG  - 393-425

AB  - Policy Points Even though most hospitals have the technological ability to
      exchange data with public health agencies, the majority continue to experience
      challenges. Most challenges are attributable to the general resources of public
      health agencies, although workforce limitations, technology issues such as a lack
      of data standards, and policy uncertainty around reporting requirements also
      remain prominent issues. Ongoing funding to support the adoption of technology
      and strengthen the development of the health informatics workforce, combined with
      revising the promotion of the interoperability scoring approach, will likely help
      improve the exchange of electronic data between hospitals and public health
      agencies. CONTEXT: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted
      significant barriers in the exchange of essential information between hospitals
      and local public health agencies. Thus it remains important to clarify the
      specific issues that hospitals may face in reporting to public health agencies to
      inform focused approaches to improve the information exchange for the current
      pandemic as well as ongoing public health activities and population health
      management. METHODS: This study uses cross-sectional data of acute-care,
      nonfederal hospitals from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey
      and Information Technology supplement. Guided by the
      technology-organization-environment framework, we coded the responses to a
      question regarding the challenges that hospitals face in submitting data to
      public health agencies by using content analysis according to the type of
      challenge (i.e., technology, organization, or environment), responsible entity
      (i.e., hospital, public health agency, vendor, multiple), and the specific issue 
      described. We used multivariable logistic and multinomial regression to identify 
      characteristics of hospitals associated with experiencing the types of
      challenges. FINDINGS: Our findings show that of the 2,794 hospitals in our
      analysis, 1,696 (61%) reported experiencing at least one challenge in reporting
      health data to a public health agency. Organizational issues were the most
      frequently reported type of challenge, noted by 1,455 hospitals. The most common 
      specific issue, reported by 1,117 hospitals, was the general resources of public 
      health agencies. An advanced EHR system and participation in a health information
      exchange both decreased the likelihood of not reporting experiencing a challenge 
      and increased the likelihood of reporting an organizational challenge.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings inform policy recommendations such as improving data
      standards, increasing funding for public health agencies to improve their
      technological capabilities, offering workforce training programs, and increasing 
      clarity of policy specifications and reporting. These approaches can improve the 
      exchange of information between hospitals and public health agencies.

TI  - Extracting Medical Information from Paper COVID-19 Assessment Forms.
PG  - 170-178
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1723024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the validity of optical mark recognition, a novel 
      user interface, and crowdsourced data validation to rapidly digitize and extract 
      data from paper COVID-19 assessment forms at a large medical center. METHODS: An 
      optical mark recognition/optical character recognition (OMR/OCR) system was
      developed to identify fields that were selected on 2,814 paper assessment forms, 
      each with 141 fields which were used to assess potential COVID-19 infections. A
      novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment
      forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the
      right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the
      results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were
      calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate
      agreement between participants. RESULTS: The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted
      data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median
      accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from
      crowd validation. Scanned forms were crowd-validated at a mean rate of 157
      seconds per document and a volume of approximately 108 documents per day. A
      randomly selected subset of documents was reviewed by multiple participants,
      producing an interobserver agreement of 97% for documents when narrative-text
      fields were included and 98% when only Boolean and multiple-choice fields were
      considered. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be challenging for
      health care workers wearing personal protective equipment to interact with
      electronic health records. The combination of OMR/OCR technology, a novel UI, and
      crowdsourcing data-validation processes allowed for the efficient extraction of a
      large volume of paper medical documents produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
