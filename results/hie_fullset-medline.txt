AB  - Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are
      currently underserved or who lack access to services, but barriers to its
      widespread utilization remain. Use of different electronic health record systems 
      (EHRs) by various health care systems is one such barrier. Utilization of
      different EHRs makes it difficult for providers to review patient data and to
      document clinical encounters. This column describes a Web portal developed by the
      North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program that connects participating
      hospital emergency departments and remote psychiatric providers, allowing them to
      share secure electronic health information regarding patient encounters across
      different EHRs.

      study.

LID - 10.1017/S1463423618000543 [doi]
AB  - AimThe aim of this study was to assess the provision of information to, and
      seeking of information by, patients newly diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica
      (PMR) in primary care. BACKGROUND: PMR is an inflammatory rheumatological
      condition of older people that can be treated with long-term oral
      glucocorticoids. Management usually requires the patient to understand the
      potential complications of treatment and the disease, as well as involvement in
      reducing treatment dose. This may be complex for patients to understand. METHOD: 
      Data are taken from the baseline phase of the PMR Cohort study, which recruited
      newly diagnosed patients with PMR from UK primary care. Participants provided
      information on their PMR symptoms, general health and sociodemographics. They
      also completed items regarding information provision by their doctor at
      diagnosis, its usefulness and their own search for information.FindingsA total of
      652 people responded to the baseline survey. In all, 399 (62.7%) had received
      written information from their doctor; 237 (98%) found it useful; 265 (42.9%)
      would have liked more information; and 311 (48.4%) sought out more information.
      Those who were not given information and did not seek it out tended to be older
      and have poorer internet access.Information provided at diagnosis to patients
      with PMR is useful, but more than a third did not receive any. This is concerning
      when PMR requires self-management and vigilance for red flags. Doctors should
      make use of the resources already available to them to support patients and
      should specifically ensure that these are available to more elderly patients and 
      those without internet access.

TI  - A snapshot of health information exchange across five nations: an investigation
      of frontline clinician experiences in emergency care.
PG  - 686-693
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx153 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Ensuring the ability to exchange patient information among disparate
      electronic health records systems is a top priority and a domain of substantial
      public investment across countries. However, we know little about the extent to
      which current capabilities meet the needs of frontline clinicians. Materials and 
      Methods: We conducted in-person, semistructured interviews with emergency care
      physicians and nurses in select hospitals in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
      and the USA. We characterized the state of health information exchange (HIE) by
      country and used thematic analysis to identify the perceived benefits of access
      to complete past medical history (PMH), the conditions under which PMH is sought,
      and the challenges to accessing and using HIE capabilities. Results: HIE
      approaches, and the information electronically accessible to clinicians, differed
      by country. Benefits of access to PMH included safer care, reduced patient length
      of stay, and fewer lab and imaging orders. Conditions under which PMH was sought 
      included moderate-acuity patients, patients with chronic conditions, and
      instances where accessing PMH was convenient. Challenges to HIE access and use
      included difficulty knowing where information is located, delay in receiving
      information, and difficulty finding information within documents. Discussion:
      Even with different HIE approaches across countries, all clinicians reported
      shortcomings in their country's approach. Notably, challenges were similar and
      shaped the conditions under which PMH was sought. Conclusion: As countries
      continue to pursue broad-based HIE, they appear to be facing similar challenges
      in realizing HIE value and therefore have an opportunity to learn from one
      another.

TI  - A population ecology perspective on the functioning and future of health
      information organizations.
PG  - 344-355
LID - 10.1097/HMR.0000000000000185 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly, health care providers need to exchange information to
      meet policy expectations and business needs. A variety of health information
      organizations (HIOs) provide services to facilitate health information exchange
      (HIE). However, the future of these organizations is unclear. PURPOSE: The aim of
      this study was to explore the environmental context, potential futures, and
      survivability of community HIOs, enterprise HIEs, and electronic health record
      vendor-mediated exchange using the population ecology theory. APPROACH:
      Qualitative interviews with 33 key informants representing each type of HIE
      organization were analyzed using template analysis. RESULTS: Community HIOs,
      enterprise HIEs, and electronic health record vendors exhibited a high degree of 
      competition for resources, especially in the area of exchange infrastructure
      services. Competition resulted in closures in some areas. In response to
      environmental pressures, each organizational type was endeavoring to
      differentiate its services and unique use case, as well as pursing symbiotic
      relationships or attempting resource partitioning. CONCLUSION: HIOs compete for
      similar resources and are reacting to environmental pressures to better position 
      themselves for continued survival and success. Our ecological research
      perspective helps move the discourse away from situation of a single exchange
      organization type toward a view of the broader dynamics and relationships of all 
      organizations involved in facilitating HIE activities. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:
      HIOs are attempting to partition the environment and differentiate services. HIE 
      options should not be construed as an "either/or" decision, but one where
      multiple and complementary participation may be required.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Frequent emergency department (ED) users are of interest to
      policymakers and hospitals. The objective of this study is to examine the effect 
      of health information exchange size on the identification of frequent ED users.
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from Healthix, a health information
      exchange in New York that previously included 10 hospitals and then grew to 31
      hospitals. We divided patients into 3 cohorts: high-frequency ED users with 4 or 
      more visits in any 30-day period, medium-frequency ED users with 4 or more visits
      in any year, and infrequent ED users with fewer than 4 visits in any year. For
      both the smaller (10-hospital) and larger (31-hospital) health information
      exchanges, we compared the identification rate of frequent ED users that was
      based on hospital-specific data with the corresponding rates that were based on
      health information exchange data. RESULTS: The smaller health information
      exchange (n=1,696,279 unique ED patients) identified 11.4% more high-frequency
      users (33,467 versus 30,057) and 9.5% more medium-frequency users (109,497 versus
      100,014) than the hospital-specific data. The larger health information exchange 
      (n=3,684,999) identified 19.6% more high-frequency patients (52,727 versus
      44,079) and 18.2% more medium-frequency patients (222,574 versus 192,541) than
      the hospital-specific data. Expanding from the smaller health information
      exchange to the larger one, we found an absolute increase of 8.2% and 8.7%
      identified high- and medium-frequency users, respectively. CONCLUSION: Increasing
      health information exchange size more accurately reflects how patients access EDs
      and ultimately improves not only the total number of identified frequent ED users
      but also their identification rate.

LID - 10.1037/pag0000567 [doi]
AB  - Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to generate predictions based on
      probabilistic dependencies in the environment, an ability that is present
      throughout life. The effect of aging on SL is still unclear. Here, we explore
      statistical learning in healthy adults (40 younger and 40 older). The novel
      paradigm tracks learning trajectories and shows age-related differences in
      overall performance, yet similarities in learning rates. Bayesian models reveal
      further differences between younger and older adults in dealing with uncertainty 
      in this probabilistic SL task. We test computational models of 3 different
      learning strategies: (a) Win-Stay, Lose-Shift, (b) Delta Rule Learning, (c)
      Information Weights to explore whether they capture age-related differences in
      performance and learning in the present task. A likely candidate mechanism
      emerges in the form of age-dependent differences in information weights, in which
      young adults more readily change their behavior, but also show disproportionally 
      strong reactions toward erroneous predictions. With lower but more balanced
      information weights, older adults show slower behavioral adaptation but
      eventually arrive at more stable and accurate representations of the underlying
      transitional probability matrix. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

TI  - Patient Monitoring System Using Cognitive Internet of Things.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1095-2 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we ponder multi-user medical image transmission using Cognitive 
      Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) Multi-carrier Code-division-multiple-access
      (MC-CDMA) system to monitor patient information. We investigate the performance
      of such system in the communication layer and application layer of internet of
      things (IOT). Patient monitoring system plays vital role in the hospital
      particularly in the emergency ward to resolve certain problems such as
      maintaining glucose level in the body, maintaining minimum sugar levels under
      emergency conditions. IOT find tremendous application in the hospital to deal
      with certain issues such as injection of drug to the patients by doctor from
      remote places, monitoring patients heart beats, sugar level by the concerned
      doctors. MIMO finds many applications in medical field to enrich data rate while 
      communication patient information at faster rate. We utilize MC-CDMA system to
      accommodate large user patients information and to transmit such information with
      high resolution by eliminating channel impairments. We are utilizing Cognitive
      spectrum for medical image transmission of higher bandwidth applications. We
      realize Double-space-time transmit diversity as MIMO profile to boost up
      throughput. We perform multi-carrier modulation using IDFT at the transmitter .we
      carryout demodulation employing DFT at the hospital. We introduce Multi-carrier
      communication to fulfil the need of bandwidth efficiency and to diminish
      frequency selectivity effects.In the application layer, we estimate patient's
      information with aid of block-nulling decoding algorithm. Moreover we analyze the
      quality of image of D-STTD MC-CDMA system with turbo style of channel encoder to 
      manifest medical image with high resolution with less signal strength. We
      conclude that Cognitive D-STTD MC-CDMA system provides reliable communication for
      the application of IOT and also transfer high resolution medical image with less 
      signal strength in order to observe patient status by doctor.

TI  - Development and Validation of an Automatic Image-Recognition Endoscopic Report
      Generation System: A Multicenter Study.
PG  - e00282
LID - 10.14309/ctg.0000000000000282 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Conventional gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy reports written by
      physicians are time consuming and might have obvious heterogeneity or omissions, 
      impairing the efficiency and multicenter consultation potential. We aimed to
      develop and validate an image recognition-based structured report generation
      system (ISRGS) through a multicenter database and to assess its diagnostic
      performance. METHODS: First, we developed and evaluated an ISRGS combining
      real-time video capture, site identification, lesion detection,
      subcharacteristics analysis, and structured report generation. White light and
      chromoendoscopy images from patients with GI lesions were eligible for study
      inclusion. A total of 46,987 images from 9 tertiary hospitals were used to train,
      validate, and multicenter test (6:2:2). Moreover, 5,699 images were prospectively
      enrolled from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to further assess the system
      in a prospective test set. The primary outcome was the diagnosis performance of
      GI lesions in multicenter and prospective tests. RESULTS: The overall accuracy in
      identifying early esophageal cancer, early gastric cancer, early colorectal
      cancer, esophageal varices, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, chronic
      atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colorectal polyp, and ulcerative colitis was
      0.8841 (95% confidence interval, 0.8775-0.8904) and 0.8965 (0.8883-0.9041) in
      multicenter and prospective tests, respectively. The accuracy of cecum and upper 
      GI site identification were 0.9978 (0.9969-0.9984) and 0.8513 (0.8399-0.8620),
      respectively. The accuracy of staining discrimination was 0.9489 (0.9396-0.9568).
      The relative error of size measurement was 4.04% (range 0.75%-7.39%). DISCUSSION:
      ISRGS is a reliable computer-aided endoscopic report generation system that might
      assist endoscopists working at various hospital levels to generate standardized
      and accurate endoscopy reports (http://links.lww.com/CTG/A485).

TI  - Enhancing a Commercial EMR with an Open, Standards-Based Publish-Subscribe
      Infrastructure.
PG  - 799-806
AB  - Intermountain Healthcare has designed and implemented a publish-subscribe
      (PubSub) infrastructure to support essential event processing workflows across
      our organization. A recent implementation of a commercial EMR highlighted the
      need to provide this capability on top of the EMR to support external
      applications and services that require access to triggering events within the
      EMR. A description of the PubSub architecture is presented. Use cases for health 
      information exchange, public health reporting, and pulmonary embolism diagnosis
      that utilize PubSub are described, along with benefits of using the paradigm.
      Besides providing support for these external applications, the PubSub
      infrastructure allows additional event handling functionality not available in
      the commercial EMR. The open, standards-based nature of the design should allow
      other organizations to implement the system in their information systems
      environment.

TI  - Tower of Babel Problem in Telehealth: Addressing the Health Information Exchange 
      Needs of the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP).
PG  - 489-495
LID - 10.1007/s11126-017-9551-6 [doi]
AB  - Telepsychiatry is a viable option for providing psychiatric care to those who are
      currently underserved or who lack access to services. While the current
      technology is adequate for most uses, and continues to advance, there remain
      barriers to its widespread utilization. One such barrier when working with
      different healthcare systems is that they utilize different electronic medical
      record systems (EMRs). This paper describes the experience of the North Carolina 
      Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP) with this problem and how the program 
      successfully resolved it by establishing a web portal that connects participating
      hospital emergency departments and remote psychiatric providers to share secure
      electronic health information regarding patient encounters across different EMRs.
      The Portal also facilitates scheduling, status tracking, and reporting on each
      patient encounter, as well as delivers the necessary data for the billing to
      process charges for each consult and to administrators for the operation of the
      program. The portal effectively bridges the needs of the multiple actors in the
      telepsychiatry virtual encounter. It provides an efficient experience for the
      patient and the point-of-care provider, a reliable document exchange for the
      psychiatric provider, and effective record keeping for the billing and government
      entities.

TI  - Advance Directives and Code Status Information Exchange: A Consensus Proposal for
      a Minimum Set of Attributes.
PG  - 178-185
LID - 10.1017/S096318011800052X [doi]
AB  - Documentation of code status and advance directives for end-of-life (EOL) care
      improves care and quality of life, decreases cost of care, and increases the
      likelihood of an experience desired by the patient and his/her family. However,
      the use of advance directives and code status remains low and only a few
      organizations maintain code status in electronic form. Members of the American
      Medical Informatics Association's Ethics Committee identified a need for a
      patient's EOL care wishes to be documented correctly and communicated easily
      through the electronic health record (EHR) using a minimum data set for the
      storage and exchange of code status information. After conducting an
      environmental scan that produced multiple resources, Ethics Committee members
      used multiple conference calls and a shared document to arrive at consensus on
      the proposed minimum data set. Ethics Committee members developed a minimum
      required data set with links to the HL7 C_CDA Advance Directives Module. Data
      categories include information on the organization obtaining the code status
      information, the patient, any supporting documentation, and finally the desired
      code status information including mandatory, optional, and conditional elements. 
      The "minimum set of attributes" to exchange advance directive / code status data 
      described in this manuscript enables communication of patient wishes across
      multiple providers and health care settings. The data elements described serve as
      a starting point for a dialog among informatics professionals, physicians
      experienced in EOL care, and EHR vendors, with the goal of developing standards
      for incorporating this functionality into the EHR systems.

TI  - Regional data exchange to improve care for veterans after non-VA hospitalization:
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 125

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordination of care, especially after a patient experiences an acute
      care event, is a challenge for many health systems. Event notification is a form 
      of health information exchange (HIE) which has the potential to support care
      coordination by alerting primary care providers when a patient experiences an
      acute care event. While promising, there exists little evidence on the impact of 
      event notification in support of reengagement into primary care. The objectives
      of this study are to 1) examine the effectiveness of event notification on health
      outcomes for older adults who experience acute care events, and 2) compare
      approaches to how providers respond to event notifications. METHODS: In a cluster
      randomized trial conducted across two medical centers within the U.S. Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA) system, we plan to enroll older patients (>/= 65
      years of age) who utilize both VHA and non-VHA providers. Patients will be
      enrolled into one of three arms: 1) usual care; 2) event notifications only; or
      3) event notifications plus a care transitions intervention. In the event
      notification arms, following a non-VHA acute care encounter, an HIE-based
      intervention will send an event notification to VHA providers. Patients in the
      event notification plus care transitions arm will also receive 30 days of care
      transition support from a social worker. The primary outcome measure is 90-day
      readmission rate. Secondary outcomes will be high risk medication discrepancies
      as well as care transitions processes within the VHA health system. Qualitative
      assessments of the intervention will inform VHA system-wide implementation.
      DISCUSSION: While HIE has been evaluated in other contexts, little evidence
      exists on HIE-enabled event notification interventions. Furthermore, this trial
      offers the opportunity to examine the use of event notifications that trigger a
      care transitions intervention to further support coordination of care. TRIAL

AB  - Because extensive data from medical records are gathered by organ procurement
      teams, the process of data transfer between sites created a data security risk.
      This includes the use of fax machines, courier services, and employees' vehicles.
      Even health records transmitted over public Wi-Fi become at risk for a data
      breach. The Plan-Do-Study-Act method for performance improvement was used to
      address this time-consuming and labor-intensive process. A secured virtual
      private network from within the donor hospital site setting was developed to
      improve the transfer of images and data. The goal was to improve the process and 
      increase data security. Once the new network was in place, the process steps
      decreased and eliminated data vulnerability. Average process time decreased by
      approximately 1 hour. Organs procured increased from pre (expected 3, observed 2)
      to post (expected 3, observed 5) implementation of the new process.

TI  - Individualized blended care for patients with colorectal cancer: the patient's
      view on informational support.
PG  - 3061-3067
LID - 10.1007/s00520-020-05810-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The number of colorectal cancer patient survivors is increasing.
      Information and support during and after treatment are requested by patients, but
      questions remain on what to provide. The aim of this study was to understand what
      informational needs colorectal cancer patients and survivors have, with a focus
      on the potential support given by patient peers and the use of blended care.
      METHODS: A qualitative study using focus groups was conducted with patients
      diagnosed at the same hospital at least one year prior to the initiation of the
      study. The focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using
      deductive content analysis. RESULTS: The need for informational support varied
      over time and depended on individual patient characteristics. Timing was crucial 
      and patients requested options of blended care and informational support after
      treatment cessation. The patients felt alone after treatment and requested
      assistance in communication with their next-of-kin. They also identified the
      value of peer support, especially to contextualize knowledge provided by
      healthcare. CONCLUSION: This study showed a need for focus on individualized
      informational support. Blended care through integrating communication with peers 
      online could be one way to support patients, both to enable shared
      decision-making as well as to provide person-centered care.

TI  - The Health and Retirement Study: Analysis of Associations Between Use of the
      Internet for Health Information and Use of Health Services at Multiple Time
      Points.
PG  - e200
LID - 10.2196/jmir.8203 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the internet for health information among older people is 
      receiving increasing attention, but how it is associated with chronic health
      conditions and health service use at concurrent and subsequent time points using 
      nationally representative data is less known. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
      determine whether the use of the internet for health information is associated
      with health service utilization and whether the association is affected by
      specific health conditions. METHODS: The study used data collected in a
      technology module from a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling
      older Americans aged 52 years and above from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study
      (HRS; N=991). Negative binomial regressions were used to examine the association 
      between use of Web-based health information and the reported health service uses 
      in 2012 and 2014. Analyses included additional covariates adjusting for
      predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Interactions between the use of the
      internet for health information and chronic health conditions were also tested.
      RESULTS: A total of 48.0% (476/991) of Americans aged 52 years and above reported
      using Web-based health information. The use of Web-based health information was
      positively associated with the concurrent reports of doctor visits, but not over 
      2 years. However, an interaction of using Web-based health information with
      diabetes showed that users had significantly fewer doctor visits compared with
      nonusers with diabetes at both times. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the internet for
      health information was associated with higher health service use at the
      concurrent time, but not at the subsequent time. The interaction between the use 
      of the internet for health information and diabetes was significant at both time 
      points, which suggests that health-related internet use may be associated with
      fewer doctor visits for certain chronic health conditions. Results provide some
      insight into how Web-based health information may provide an alternative health
      care resource for managing chronic conditions.

      health forums.
PG  - e0209961
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0209961 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surveys indicate that patients, particularly those suffering from
      chronic conditions, strongly benefit from the information found in social
      networks and online forums. One challenge in accessing online health information 
      is to differentiate between factual and more subjective information. In this
      work, we evaluate the feasibility of exploiting lexical, syntactic, semantic,
      network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify
      patient-generated contents into three types: "experiences", "facts" and
      "opinions", using machine learning algorithms. In this context, our goal is to
      develop automatic methods that will make online health information more easily
      accessible and useful for patients, professionals and researchers. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: We work with a set of 3000 posts to online health forums in breast
      cancer, morbus crohn and different allergies. Each sentence in a post is manually
      labeled as "experience", "fact" or "opinion". Using this data, we train a support
      vector machine algorithm to perform classification. The results are evaluated in 
      a 10-fold cross validation procedure. RESULTS: Overall, we find that it is
      possible to predict the type of information contained in a forum post with a very
      high accuracy (over 80 percent) using simple text representations such as word
      embeddings and bags of words. We also analyze more complex features such as those
      based on the network properties, the polarity of words and the verbal tense of
      the sentences and show that, when combined with the previous ones, they can boost
      the results.

TI  - Sharing health data in Belgium: A home care case study using the Vitalink
      platform.
PG  - 56-72
LID - 10.1080/17538157.2016.1269107 [doi]
AB  - In 2013, the Flemish Government launched the Vitalink platform. This initiative
      focuses on the sharing of health and welfare data to support primary healthcare. 
      In this paper, the objectives and mission of the Vitalink initiative are
      discussed. Security and privacy measures are reviewed, and the technical
      implementation of the Vitalink platform is presented. Through a case study, the
      possibility of interaction with cloud solutions for healthcare is also
      investigated upon; this was initially not the focus of Vitalink. The Vitalink
      initiative provides support for secure data sharing in primary healthcare, which 
      in the long term will improve the efficiency of care and will decrease costs.
      Based on the results of the case study, Vitalink allowed cloud solutions or
      applications not providing end-to-end security to use their system. The most
      important lesson learned during this research was the need for firm regulations
      and stipulations for cloud solutions to interact with the Vitalink platform.
      However, these are currently still vague.

TI  - Vendor of choice and the effectiveness of policies to promote health information 
      exchange.
PG  - 405
LID - 10.1186/s12913-018-3230-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As more hospitals adopt Electronic Health Records (EHR), focus has
      shifted to how these records can be used to improve patient care. One barrier to 
      this improvement is limited information exchange between providers. In this work 
      we examine the role of EHR vendors, hypothesizing that vendors strategically
      control the exchange of clinical care summaries. Their strategy may involve the
      creation of networks that easily exchange information between providers with the 
      same vendor but frustrate exchange between providers with different vendors, even
      as both Federal and State policies attempt to incentivize exchange through a
      common format. METHODS: Using data from the 2013 American Hospital Association's 
      Information Technology Supplement, we examine the relationship between a
      hospital's decision to share clinical care summaries outside of their network and
      EHR vendor market share, measured by the percentage of hospitals that have the
      same vendor in a Hospital Referral Region. RESULTS: Our findings show that the
      likelihood of a hospital exchanging clinical summaries with hospitals outside its
      health system increases as the percentage of hospitals with the same EHR vendor
      in the region increases. The estimated odds of a hospital sharing clinical care
      summaries outside their system is 5.4 (95% CI, 3.29-8.80) times greater if all
      hospitals in the Hospital Referral Region use the same EHR Vendor than the
      corresponding odds for a hospital in an area with no hospitals using the same EHR
      Vendor. When reviewing the relationship of vendor market concentration at the
      state level we find a positive significant relationship with the percentage of
      hospitals that share clinical care summaries within a state. We find no
      significant impact from state policies designed to incentivize information
      exchange through the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Program.
      CONCLUSION: There are benefits to exchanging using proprietary methods that are
      strengthened when the vendors are more concentrated. In order to avoid closed
      networks that foreclose some hospitals, it is important that future regulation
      attempt to be more inclusive of hospitals that do not use large vendors and are
      therefore unable to use proprietary methods for exchange.

AB  - PURPOSE: Secondary usage of patient data has recently become of increasing
      interest for the development and application of computer analytic techniques.
      Strict oversight of these data is required and the individual patients themselves
      are integral to providing guidance. We sought to understand patients' attitudes
      to sharing their imaging data for research purposes. These images could provide a
      great wealth of information for researchers. METHODS: Patients from the Greater
      Toronto Area attending Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for imaging (magnetic
      resonance imagining, computed tomography, or ultrasound) examination areas were
      invited to participate in an electronic survey. RESULTS: Of the 1083 patients who
      were approached (computed tomography 609, ultrasound 314, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging 160), 798 (74%) agreed to take the survey. Overall median age was 60
      (interquartile range = 18, Q1 = 52, Q3 = 70), 52% were women, 42% had a
      university degree, and 7% had no high school diploma. In terms of willingness to 
      share de-identified medical images for research, 76% were willing (agreed and
      strongly agreed), while 7% refused. Most participants gave their family
      physicians (73%) and other physicians (57%) unconditional data access.
      Participants chose hospitals/research institutions to regulate electronic images 
      databases (70%), 89% wanted safeguards against unauthorized access to their data,
      and over 70% wanted control over who will be permitted, for how long, and the
      ability to revoke that permission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that people are
      willing to share their clinically acquired de-identified medical images for
      research studies provided that they have control over permissions and duration of
      access.

      benefits and costs of seeking and using health information from online sources.
PG  - 153-167
LID - 10.1111/hir.12250 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to explore the determinants of the online health
      information seeking (OHIS) and usage (OHIU) behaviours of consumers based on the 
      perceived benefits and costs of such activities. METHODS: This study applies
      questionnaires and empirical research methods. A questionnaire is designed
      according to the hypothesis model. A total of 282 questionnaires are obtained
      from patients and their accompanying families in two large hospitals, and the
      SPSS 17.0 and AMOS 17.0 (IBM, Almond, NY, USA) software are used to analyse the
      sample data and to test the research models. RESULTS: Three key findings are
      obtained from the analysis. Firstly, functional, learning, social and personal
      integrative benefits positively affect the OHIS intent of consumers. Secondly,
      cognitive costs negatively influence the OHIU behaviour of consumers. Thirdly,
      personal integrative benefits and OHIS behaviour significantly influence the OHIU
      behaviour of consumers. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the differences between
      OHIS and OHIU based on their impact factors and applies social exchange theory to
      understand such factors. Online health information providers must improve the
      ease of use of their websites or applications, enhance the quality of their
      health information and focus on their functionality.

TI  - Towards Designing a Secure Exchange Platform for Diabetes Monitoring and Therapy.
PG  - 239-246
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prominent examples of chronic
      conditions that requires an active patient self-management and a network of
      specialists. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the user and legal 
      requirements and develop a rough technology concept for a secure and
      patient-centered exchange platform. METHODS: To this end, 14 experts representing
      different stakeholders were interviewed and took part in group discussions at
      three workshops, the pertinent literature and legal texts were analyzed. RESULTS:
      The user requirements embraced a comprehensive set of use cases and the demand
      for "one platform for all" which is underlined by the right for data portability 
      according to new regulations. In order to meet these requirements a distributed
      ledger technology was proposed. CONCLUSION: We will therefore focus on a
      patient-centered application that showcases self-management and exchange with
      health specialists.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI210199 [doi]
AB  - Today, the demand for health-oriented systems to facilitate and improve treatment
      processes is growing. For different information systems with different structures
      and technologies to be able to communicate with each other, a single gateway is
      required. The gateway acts as an interface between information systems and
      unifies protocols, rules, and standards related to communication processes.
      Health-related systems need a unique regulator that explains data models, coding,
      and data exchange structures. Moreover, the gateway has control over information 
      systems and the data transmitted between them. In this paper, we explain an
      integrated gateway of health information exchange named DITAS which is a bridging
      point between health-related systems.

TI  - Construction of RSA-Based Authentication Scheme in Authorized Access to
      Healthcare Services : Authorized Access to Healthcare Services.

AB  - Modern network technology yields new interface for telecare medicine information 
      systems in short TMIS used for patient's healthcare. This system is used to
      provide healthcare services to patients at their home. It can be observed,
      telecare medicine information systems generally suffer several attacks as
      information being transmitted over a public network. Therefore, various
      authentication and key agreement schemes are proposed for TMIS to ensure secure
      and authorized patients communication over given public network. However, most of
      the schemes fail to achieve essential attributes discussed in this article.
      Although the key attributes of security and efficiency should be achieved in a
      common framework. This paper proposes construction of an RSA based authentication
      scheme for authorized access to healthcare services and achieves desirable key
      attributes of authentication protocols. Proof of security against polynomial time
      adversary is given in the random oracle to justify the security of proposed
      scheme. Communication analysis and computation analysis of proposed scheme
      indicates that proposed scheme's performance is comparable and having better
      security.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study seeks to understand the key inhibitors for health information
      exchange (HIE) by ambulatory (outpatient) clinics. We examine the key
      technological, organizational and environmental factors that inhibit an
      ambulatory clinic from electronically exchanging health information with external
      clinics and hospitals. METHODS: We utilize survey data from 1285 ambulatory
      clinics in the US state of Minnesota. Using logistic regressions, we assess if
      the ambulatory clinic's HIE with external clinics and external hospitals are
      associated with fourteen inhibitors from technological, organizational and
      environmental contexts in which ambulatory clinics operate. RESULTS: Among the
      technological inhibitors, we find lack of adequate technological infrastructure, 
      difficulties in integrating external data with electronic medical record systems,
      and security concerns to inhibit ambulatory clinics' HIE with both clinics and
      hospitals. Inadequate technical support was a barrier for HIE with hospitals,
      whereas inadequate training of staff was an inhibitor for clinic-to-clinic HIE.
      Of the environmental variables, legal concerns and complexity in framing HIE
      agreements with partners were found to inhibit ambulatory clinics' HIE with both 
      external clinics and hospitals. Lack of partner readiness and ability was an
      inhibiting factor for clinic-to-hospital HIE whereas issues in patient consent,
      and problems in choosing the right vendor with a good fit were inhibiting
      ambulatory clinics' HIE with other clinics. Among the organizational variables,
      lack of adequate senior leadership support and complexity of workflow changes
      inhibited clinic-to-clinic health data sharing, whereas unclear return on
      investment (ROI) for HIE was a deterrent for ambulatory clinics' HIE with
      hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: This study throws light on electronic HIE practices and
      its key inhibitors in ambulatory clinics, an understudied area in digital health.
      This paper provides unique insights into specific inhibitors that deter
      clinic-to-clinic health information sharing versus those that affect and
      clinic-to-hospital health information exchange.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A mobile application for personal health records (PHR) 
      would allow patients to access their clinical data easily. When PHR connects with
      multiple electronic health records (EHRs), doctors and patients can exchange
      large quantities of patient data from the EHR (e.g., medication list, diagnoses, 
      allergies, and laboratory data). Furthermore, personal daily records can also be 
      retrieved from PHR (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, dietary habits, and exercise).
      However, no standard interoperability between EHRs and PHR has been established. 
      This study aims to convert clinical data in EHRs into the Health Level Seven
      (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data format while
      developing a PHR application to present the FHIR data. METHODS: In Japan,
      Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange version 2 (SS-MIX2) is
      typically utilized as a health information exchange to preserve and elicit
      clinical data from EHRs. We converted clinical data in the SS-MIX2 storage at
      Tohoku University Hospital into the FHIR repository server using the R4 standard.
      Additionally, we used the Swift programming language to build a PHR application. 
      RESULTS: We converted patients' basic information, disease names, diagnostic
      reports, prescriptions, and injection data from the SS-MIX2 to the FHIR server.
      Besides, we launched a PHR application that could retrieve data from the FHIR
      server to display patients' clinical information. CONCLUSIONS: Our work
      demonstrated the conversion of SS-MIX2 data into the FHIR and presented them with
      our PHR application. This mechanism may be useful to accelerate the sharing of
      clinical information among doctors and patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of machine learning techniques is especially pertinent to the
      composite and challenging conditions of emergency departments (EDs). Repeat ED
      visits (i.e. revisits) are an example of potentially inappropriate utilization of
      resources that can be forecasted by these techniques. OBJECTIVE: To track the ED 
      revisit risk over time using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a major latent
      class model. Given the HMM states, we carried out forecasting of future ED
      revisits with various data mining models. METHODS: Information integrated from
      four distributed sources (e.g. electronic health records and health information
      exchange) was integrated into four HMMs which capture the relationships between
      an observed and a hidden progression that shift over time through a series of
      hidden states in an adult patient population. RESULTS: Assimilating a
      pre-analysis of the various patients by applying latent class models and
      directing them to well-known classifiers functioned well. The performance was
      significantly better than without utilizing pre-analysis of HMM for all
      prediction models (classifiers(. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that one
      prospective approach to advanced risk prediction is to leverage the longitudinal 
      nature of health care data by exploiting patients' between state variation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To exchange patient health information using Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) projects, such information first should be collected
      thoroughly using an appropriate data entry interface that reinforces information 
      quality (IQ). Assessment of the given data interface based on its structure level
      may give us a better understanding of patients' attitudes toward
      information-sharing efforts. The main objective of this study is to examine the
      effects of data structure on perceptions and attitudes of patients toward the
      quality of health information that may be shared through HIE networks. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Eight experiments were conducted to examine the impact of different 
      design of information collection interfaces (structured vs. unstructured) to
      record two types of health information (sensitive vs. non-sensitive) that can be 
      used for two types of sharing purposes (health care vs. marketing). RESULTS:
      Results show that the degree of data entry structure can significantly influence 
      patients' perceptions of completeness, accuracy, psychological risk,
      accessibility of data, concise representation, and understandability of health
      information. DISCUSSION: There is a connection between data entry interface
      design and patients' perceptions of the quality of health information used in HIE
      networks, which in turn, could lead to the development of best practices in
      interface design and data collection techniques. This may also improve
      interactions between patients and healthcare entities, enhance patients'
      attitudes toward data collection procedures and HIE, and help healthcare
      providers use complete and accurate databases. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that
      healthcare professionals can tailor data entry interfaces based on the
      sensitivity of medical data and the purpose of information exchange.

TI  - Designing a Distributed Ledger Technology System for Interoperable and General
      Data Protection Regulation-Compliant Health Data Exchange: A Use Case in Blood
      Glucose Data.
PG  - e13665
LID - 10.2196/13665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distributed ledger technology (DLT) holds great potential to improve 
      health information exchange. However, the immutable and transparent character of 
      this technology may conflict with data privacy regulations and data processing
      best practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to develop a proof-of-concept
      system for immutable, interoperable, and General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR)-compliant exchange of blood glucose data. METHODS: Given that there is no 
      ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed
      two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based
      purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT)
      and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private
      InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according
      to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4)
      file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity. RESULTS: The public
      IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an
      overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one
      blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. 
      The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both
      reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months
      of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), 
      but involved a relatively higher setup complexity. CONCLUSIONS: For the specific 
      use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a
      suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between
      patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the 
      latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment
      with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the
      conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful
      considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data
      exchange system.

TI  - Mothers' Perceptions of the Internet and Social Media as Sources of Parenting and
      Health Information: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e14289
LID - 10.2196/14289 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, guidance and support to new parents have come from
      family, friends, and health care providers. However, the internet and social
      media are growing sources of guidance and support for parents. Little is known
      about how the internet and social media are used by parents of young infants and 
      specifically about parental perceptions of the internet and social media as
      sources of parenting and infant health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
      study was to explore, using qualitative methods, parental perceptions of the
      advantages and disadvantages of the internet and social media as sources of
      parenting and health information regarding their infant. METHODS: A total of 28
      mothers participated in focus groups or individual interviews. Probing questions 
      concerning parenting and health information sources were asked. Themes were
      developed in an iterative manner from coded data. RESULTS: The central themes
      were (1) reasons that mothers turn to the internet for parenting and health
      information, (2) cautionary advice about the internet, and (3) reasons that
      mothers turn to social media for parenting and health information. Mothers
      appreciated the ability to gather unlimited information and multiple opinions
      quickly and anonymously, but recognized the need to use reputable sources of
      information. Mothers also appreciated the immediacy of affirmation, support, and 
      tailored information available through social media. CONCLUSIONS: The internet
      and social media are rapidly becoming important and trusted sources of parenting 
      and health information that mothers turn to when making infant care decisions.

      Countries With Different Health Care System Configurations.
PG  - 299-311
LID - 10.1177/1077558719858245 [doi]
AB  - The sharing of information among various care providers is becoming an essential 
      feature of health care systems, and many countries are now adopting policies to
      foster health information exchange, defined as the electronic transfer of data or
      information among health care organizations involved in the delivery of care.
      Given the increasing adoption of this type of policy in several Organization for 
      Economic Cooperation and Development countries, it is important to compare
      experiences from different countries, because policy adoption in one country can 
      be explained more comprehensively and coherently through comparison with similar 
      policies adopted in other nations. To make a more meaningful cross-country
      comparison, this article identifies a taxonomy of health systems, and it analyzes
      institutional and resource-based factors related to health information exchange
      adoption and how they differ in three main types of health systems: the National 
      Health Service, social health insurance, and private health insurance.

TI  - Coding Free-Text Chief Complaints from a Health Information Exchange: A
      Preliminary Study.
PG  - 638-647
AB  - Chief complaints are important textual data that can serve to enrich diagnosis
      and symptom data in electronic health record (EHR) systems. In this study, a
      method is presented to preprocess chief complaints and assign corresponding
      ICD-10-CM codes using the MetaMap natural language processing (NLP) system and
      Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. An exploratory analysis was
      conducted using a set of 7,942 unique chief complaints from the statewide health 
      information exchange containing EHR data from hospitals across Rhode Island. An
      evaluation of the proposed method was then performed using a set of 123,086 chief
      complaints with corresponding ICD-10-CM encounter diagnoses. With 87.82% of
      MetaMap-extracted concepts correctly assigned, the preliminary findings support
      the potential use of the method explored in this study for improving upon
      existing NLP techniques for enabling use of data captured within chief complaints
      to support clinical care, research, and public health surveillance.

TI  - Development of a Secure Cross-Institutional Data Collection System Based on
      Distributed Standardized EMR Storage.
PG  - 35-39
AB  - This paper describes a secure data collection infrastructure involving
      standardized electronic medical record (EMR) storage and Private Set
      Intersection, a secure data collection technology based on Bloom filter. The
      objective of this infrastructure is to facilitate rapid secondary use of exported
      EMR data in cross-patient or cross-institutional analyses based on the
      Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange (SS-MIX), Japan's domestic
      standard for EMR exporting. Design of the infrastructure and its underlying
      concepts are described herein. In an experimental test, an intersection operation
      involving approximately 1 million records was completed within a minute; this
      result is expected to be representative of the system in actual use. In
      forthcoming work, we plan to verify the system performance using larger data
      sets.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) enables
      physicians to efficiently and conveniently make certain diagnoses and medical
      treatment for patients over the insecure public Internet. To ensure patients
      securely access to medicinal services, many authentication schemes have been
      proposed. Although numerous cryptographic authentication schemes for TMIS have
      been proposed with the aim to ensure data security, user privacy and
      authentication, various forms of attacks make these schemes impractical. METHODS:
      To design a truly secure and practical authentication scheme for TMIS, a new
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS
      without sharing the system private key with distributed servers is presented in
      this work. RESULTS: Our proposed protocol has perfect security features including
      mutual authentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and resisting
      various well-known attacks, and these security feathers are confirmed by the BAN 
      logic and heuristic cryptanalysis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A secure
      biometrics-based authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server TMIS is
      presented in this work, which has perfect security properties including perfect
      forward secrecy, supporting user anonymity, etc., and can withstand various
      attacks such as impersonation attack, off-line password guessing attack, etc..
      Considering security is the most important factor for an authentication scheme,
      so our scheme is more suitable for multi-server TMIS.

TI  - Perceptions of Radiologists and Emergency Medicine Providers Regarding the
      Quality, Value, and Challenges of Outside Image Sharing in the Emergency
      Department Setting.
PG  - 843-852
LID - 10.2214/AJR.19.22096 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to assess the perceptions of radiologists
      and emergency medicine (EM) providers regarding the quality, value, and
      challenges associated with using outside imaging (i.e., images obtained at
      facilities other than their own institution). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We surveyed 
      radiologists and EM providers at a large academic medical center regarding their 
      perceptions of the availability and utility of outside imaging. RESULTS.
      Thirty-four of 101 radiologists (33.6%) and 38 of 197 EM providers (19.3%)
      responded. A total of 32.4% of radiologists and 55.3% of EM providers had
      confidence in the quality of images from outside community facilities; 20.6% and 
      44.7%, respectively, had confidence in the interpretations of radiologists from
      these outside facilities. Only 23.5% of radiologists and 5.3% of EM physicians
      were confident in their ability to efficiently access reports (for outside
      images, 47.1% and 5.3%). Very few radiologists and EM providers had accessed
      imaging reports from outside facilities through an available stand-alone portal. 
      A total of 40.6% of radiologists thought that outside reports always or
      frequently reduced additional imaging recommendations (62.5% for outside images);
      15.6% thought that reports changed interpretations of new examinations (37.5% for
      outside images); and 43.8% thought that reports increased confidence in
      interpretations of new examinations (75.0% for outside images). A total of 29.4% 
      of EM providers thought that access to reports from outside facilities reduced
      repeat imaging (64.7% for outside images), 41.2% thought that they changed
      diagnostic or management plans (50.0% for outside images), and 50.0% thought they
      increased clinical confidence (67.6% for outside images). CONCLUSION.
      Radiologists and EM providers perceive high value in sharing images from outside 
      facilities, despite quality concerns. Substantial challenges exist in accessing
      these images and reports from outside facilities, and providers are unlikely to
      do so using separate systems. However, even if information technology solutions
      for seamless image integration are adopted, providers' lack of confidence in
      outside studies may remain an important barrier.

TI  - Quantifying benefits of using health information exchange to support public
      health STI reporting and treatment in Western New York.
PG  - 42-47
LID - 10.1177/1833358317732024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To calculate average savings of using health information exchange
      (HIE) for demographic and treatment requests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in
      Western New York, specifically the Erie County Department of Health and its
      catchment area. METHOD:: We conducted a mixed-method case study. Qualitative
      methods included interviews, document review, and workflow mapping, which were
      used as the inputs to identify time savings. Case rates, time savings, and salary
      averages were used to calculate average savings. RESULTS:: The avoided
      demographic information requests resulted in time and money savings (range of
      USD$2312-USD$4624 for chlamydia and USD$809-USD$1512 for gonorrhoea) as did
      avoided treatment requests (range of USD$671-USD$2803 for chlamydia and
      USD$981-USD$1635 for gonorrhoea). DISCUSSION:: HIE supported sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) treatment by making it easier for public health staff to identify
      and act upon STI diagnoses. Availability of information online resulted in less
      reliance on provider offices for demographic and treatment information.
      CONCLUSION:: Results indicated that using HIE to support treatment and management
      of STIs can save public health staff time spent on obtaining demographic and
      treatment information. Other public health departments could use HIE for this and
      other types of disease surveillance activities. Considering public health needs
      in HIE development and use can improve efficiency of public health services and
      enhance effectiveness of activities.

TI  - Do Market Characteristics Matter? Factors Associated with Health Information
      Exchange.
LID - 11976 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182211976 [doi]
AB  - This study explores factors associated with the breadth (extent) and depth (level
      of detail) of digital information exchange among stakeholders in health
      information technology (IT) systems. Annual and IT surveys of the American
      Hospital Association and the U.S. Census Bureau's small-area income and poverty
      estimates from 2014-2016 were analyzed for associations between key factors and
      breadth and depth of information exchange. OLS Regression was used with a sample 
      consisting of 10,040 year-hospital observations. We found that hospital-level
      variables such as size, ownership type, system affiliation, physician-hospital
      arrangement, and revenue model affect information exchange. We further found that
      market-level variables such as concentration ratio, urbanness, and median
      household income, although they directly affect information exchange, do not
      moderate the relationship between hospital-level variables and information
      exchange. Our study fills a gap in the previous literature arising from the lack 
      of research on the determinants of health information exchange.

TI  - Impact of the 2015 Health Information Technology Certification Edition on
      Interoperability among Hospitals.
PG  - 1866-1873
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab083 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most nonfederal acute care hospitals use electronic health records
      (EHRs) certified by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
      Technology. In 2015, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health
      Information Technology finalized the 2015 Health IT Certification Edition and
      adoption by hospitals began in 2016. We examine the impact of the 2015 Edition on
      rates of interoperable exchange among nonfederal acute hospitals. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The study applies a standard difference-in-differences design and a
      recently developed fixed effects estimator that relaxes the assumption of
      treatment effects being constant across groups and time. In the analysis, we
      identify separate effects of the 2015 Edition for hospitals that switched EHR
      developers and forecast hospitals' interoperability over 2015 Edition adoption
      rates. RESULTS: The adoption of the 2015 Edition increased hospitals' rates of
      interoperable exchange and especially benefited hospitals that switched EHR
      developers in the post-implementation period. Forecasting results indicate that
      if all hospitals adopted the 2015 Edition, 53% to 61% of hospitals would engage
      in interoperable health information exchange compared with the current rate of
      46%. DISCUSSION: Hospitals' levels of interoperability have been rising over the 
      last few years. Adoption of newer technology improved hospitals' interoperability
      and accounts for up to 12% of the rise in interoperability. CONCLUSIONS:
      Certified technology is one mechanism to ensure providers use recent and safe
      technologies for interoperable exchange. Adoption of certified EHRs improves the 
      nation's interoperable exchange; however, it has a clear limited effect. Other
      mechanisms are necessary for achieving comprehensive interoperable exchange.

      coordination of complex pediatric patients.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Seamless access to information about the individuals and organizations
      involved in the care of a specific patient ("care teams") is crucial to effective
      and efficient care coordination. This is especially true for vulnerable and
      complex patient populations such as pediatric patients with special needs.
      Despite wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR), current EHR systems do 
      not adequately support the visualization and management of care teams within and 
      across health care organizations. Electronic health information exchange has the 
      potential to address this issue. In the present study, we assessed the adequacy
      of available health information exchange data standards to support the
      information needs related to care coordination of complex pediatric patients.
      METHODS: We derived data elements from the information needs of clinicians and
      parents to support patient care teams; and mapped them to data elements in the
      Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA)
      standard and in the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
      standard. We also identified additional C-CDA data elements and FHIR resources
      that include patients' care team members. RESULTS: Information about care team
      members involved in patient care is generally well-represented in the C-CDA and
      FHIR specifications. However, there are gaps related to patients' non-clinical
      events and care team actions. In addition, there is no single place to find
      information about care team members; rather, information about practitioners and 
      organizations may be available in several different types of C-CDA data elements 
      and FHIR resources. CONCLUSION: Through standards-based electronic health
      information exchange, it appears to be feasible to build patient care team
      representations irrespective of the location of patient care. In order to gather 
      care team information across disparate systems, exchange of multiple C-CDA
      documents and/or execution of multiple FHIR queries will be necessary. This
      approach has the potential to enable comprehensive patient care team views that
      may help improve care coordination.

TI  - Information blocking remains prevalent at the start of 21st Century Cures Act:
      results from a survey of health information exchange organizations.
PG  - 727-732
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa323 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent policy making aims to prevent health systems, lectronic health 
      record (EHR) vendors, and others from blocking the electronic sharing of patient 
      data necessary for clinical care. We sought to assess the prevalence of
      information blocking prior to enforcement of these rules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We conducted a national survey of health information exchange organizations
      (HIEs) to measure the prevalence of information blocking behaviors observed by
      these third-party entities. Eighty-nine of 106 HIEs (84%) meeting the inclusion
      criteria responded. RESULTS: The majority (55%) of HIEs reported that EHR vendors
      at least sometimes engage in information blocking, while 30% of HIEs reported the
      same for health systems. The most common type of information blocking behavior
      EHR vendors engaged in was setting unreasonably high prices, which 42% of HIEs
      reported routinely observing. The most common type of information blocking
      behavior health systems engaged in was refusing to share information, which 14%
      of HIEs reported routinely observing. Reported levels of vendor information
      blocking was correlated with regional competition among vendors and information
      blocking was concentrated in some geographic regions. DISCUSSION: Our findings
      are consistent with early reports, revealing persistently high levels of
      information blocking and important variation by actor, type of behavior, and
      geography. These trends reflect the observations and experiences of HIEs and
      their potential biases. Nevertheless, these data serve as a baseline against
      which to measure the impact of new regulations and to inform policy makers about 
      the most common types of information blocking behaviors. CONCLUSION: Enforcement 
      aimed at reducing information blocking should consider variation in prevalence
      and how to most effectively target efforts.

TI  - Perspectives of Patients, Health Care Professionals, and Developers Toward
      Blockchain-Based Health Information Exchange: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e18582
LID - 10.2196/18582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the electronic health record system adoption rate has
      reached 96% in the United States, implementation and usage of health information 
      exchange (HIE) is still lagging behind. Blockchain has come into the spotlight as
      a technology to solve this problem. However, there have been no studies assessing
      the perspectives of different stakeholders regarding blockchain-based
      patient-centered HIE. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the
      awareness among patients, health care professionals, and information technology
      developers toward blockchain-based HIE, and compare their different perspectives 
      related to the platform using a qualitative research methodology. METHODS: In
      this qualitative study, we applied grounded theory and the Promoting Action on
      Research Implementation in the Health Service (PARiHS) framework. We interviewed 
      7 patients, 7 physicians, and 7 developers, for a total of 21 interviewees.
      RESULTS: Regarding the leakage of health information, the patient group did not
      have concerns in contrast to the physician and developer groups. Physicians were 
      particularly concerned about the fact that errors in the data cannot be easily
      fixed due to the nature of blockchain technology. Patients were not against the
      idea of providing information for clinical trials or research institutions. They 
      wished to be provided with the results of clinical research rather than being
      compensated for providing data. The developers emphasized that blockchain must be
      technically mature before it can be applied to the health care scene, and
      standards of medical information to be exchanged must first be established.
      CONCLUSIONS: The three groups' perceptions of blockchain were generally positive 
      about the idea of patients having the control of sharing their own health
      information. However, they were skeptical about the cooperation among various
      institutions and implementation for data standardization in the establishment
      process, in addition to how the service will be employed in practice. Taking
      these factors into consideration during planning, development, and operation of a
      platform will contribute to establishing practical treatment plans and tracking
      in a more convenient manner for both patients and physicians. Furthermore, it
      will help expand the related research and health management industry based on
      blockchain.

TI  - Li-Fraumeni Exploration Consortium Data Coordinating Center: Building an
      Interactive Web-Based Resource for Collaborative International Cancer
      Epidemiology Research for a Rare Condition.
PG  - 927-935
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-1113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of multisite collaborative research relies on effective
      data collection, harmonization, and aggregation strategies. Data Coordination
      Centers (DCC) serve to facilitate the implementation of these strategies. The
      utility of a DCC can be particularly relevant for research on rare diseases where
      collaboration from multiple sites to amass large aggregate datasets is essential.
      However, approaches to building a DCC have been scarcely documented. METHODS: The
      Li-Fraumeni Exploration (LiFE) Consortium's DCC was created using multiple open
      source packages, including LAM/G Application (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Grails),
      Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) Pentaho Data Integration Tool, and the
      Saiku-Mondrian client. This document serves as a resource for building a rare
      disease DCC for multi-institutional collaborative research. RESULTS: The primary 
      scientific and technological objective to create an online central repository
      into which data from all participating sites could be deposited, harmonized,
      aggregated, disseminated, and analyzed was completed. The cohort now include
      2,193 participants from six contributing sites, including 1,354 individuals from 
      families with a pathogenic or likely variant in TP53. Data on cancer diagnoses
      are also available. Challenges and lessons learned are summarized. CONCLUSIONS:
      The methods leveraged mitigate challenges associated with successfully developing
      a DCC's technical infrastructure, data harmonization efforts, communications, and
      software development and applications. IMPACT: These methods can serve as a
      framework in establishing other collaborative research efforts. Data from the
      consortium will serve as a great resource for collaborative research to improve
      knowledge on, and the ability to care for, individuals and families with
      Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

TI  - The Impact for Medical Management of the Health Information Exchange Through
      Changes of the Number of the First Visit Patients and Admission Patients in
      Japan.
PG  - 1726-1727
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190617 [doi]
AB  - Recently Health Information Exchange (HIE) is gradually spreading in Japan. But
      there are few reports about the effect of the hospital management. So we examined
      the effect for hospital management through the number of the newly admitted
      patients from 2013 to 2017. In this study both the total number of the admitted
      patients who was reserved as first visit patients was higher than not reserved
      and the number of the admitted patients who visited with introduction letters was
      higher than without introduction letters. (p < 0.01) The total number of the
      admitted patients who had been registered to the Ajisai-net was 624 (41.2%) for
      the same 5 years, and was revealed to be significantly higher than the number of 
      the admitted patients who was reserved first visit with introduction letters. (p 
      < 0.01) In conclusion, use of the Japanese type of the HIE has a potential to
      increase the newly admitted patients finally.

TI  - Transforming electronic health record polysomnographic data into the
      Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model: a pilot
      feasibility study.
PG  - 7013
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-86564-w [doi]
AB  - Well-defined large-volume polysomnographic (PSG) data can identify subgroups and 
      predict outcomes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, current PSG data are 
      scattered across numerous sleep laboratories and have different formats in the
      electronic health record (EHR). Hence, this study aimed to convert EHR PSG into a
      standardized data format-the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP)
      common data model (CDM). We extracted the PSG data of a university hospital for
      the period from 2004 to 2019. We designed and implemented an
      extract-transform-load (ETL) process to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM
      format and verified the data quality through expert evaluation. We converted the 
      data of 11,797 sleep studies into CDM and added 632,841 measurements and 9,535
      observations to the existing CDM database. Among 86 PSG parameters, 20 were
      mapped to CDM standard vocabulary and 66 could not be mapped; thus, new custom
      standard concepts were created. We validated the conversion and usefulness of PSG
      data through patient-level prediction analyses for the CDM data. We believe that 
      this study represents the first CDM conversion of PSG. In the future, CDM
      transformation will enable network research in sleep medicine and will contribute
      to presenting more relevant clinical evidence.

      increased sharing of patients.
PG  - 128-135
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13240 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: One potential benefit of greater electronic health information
      exchange is a reduction in the effort required for patients to switch between
      providers. We therefore assessed whether hospital participation in health
      information organizations (HIOs) led to increased patient sharing. DATA SOURCES: 
      Secondary data from 2010 to 2016. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital-pair and year
      fixed effects regression models, we assessed change in patient sharing volume
      following HIO participation by hospitals and compared the effect by the level of 
      market competition and by hospital size. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: We used
      national data on hospital participation in HIOs from the American Hospital
      Association Information Technology Supplement and data on the volume of Medicare 
      patients shared between pairs of hospitals from 2010 to 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      The volume of patients shared between hospitals increased by 2.6 percent when
      both hospitals participated in a health information organization (P = .008, 95%
      CI: 0.7%-4.5%). This increase was greater in competitive markets (3.1 percent
      increase, P = .03 95% CI: 0.3%-5.9%) and between large hospitals (4.3 percent
      increase, P = .007 95% CI: 1.2%-7.3%). Participation by only one hospital in a
      pair had no effect on patient sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an
      important policy goal motivating the investment in health information exchange
      has been at least partially achieved. However, our results also support hospital 
      concerns about the competitive implications of engaging in health information
      exchange. HIO participation appears to facilitate patient movement between
      hospitals, likely by lowering switching costs and resulting in greater
      competition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the experiences with, opinions of, and reactions to online
      cancer information of loved ones of people with cancer. SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: 10 
      loved ones of people with cancer recruited from a pool of participants who
      completed a survey about cancer website experiences. METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES:
      Qualitative, semistructured interview questions concerned the perceived value of 
      and reactions to online cancer information. Responses were analyzed using a
      grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Cancer websites play an important role, often 
      serving as a first source of information. All participants said the Internet was 
      helpful but could lead to negative emotions or misinformation. Future efforts
      should seek to mitigate the negative effects associated with the use of such
      websites. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Healthcare providers should direct people
      with cancer and their loved ones to reputable websites that provide support in
      conjunction with information, or work toward developing their own in-depth
      resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread use of prescription opioids is associated with adverse
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with adverse health outcomes 
      and health care use using a statewide health information exchange. METHODS: This 
      is a retrospective cohort study using the Indiana Network for Patient Care. Adult
      opioid-naive patients who received an opioid prescription between January 2012
      and December 2017 were included. The outcomes included (1) a composite outcome of
      any combination of opioid abuse, dependence, or overdose, (2) all-cause
      mortality, and (3) health care use. Independent variables included opioid dosage,
      dispensed amount, days supply, concurrent use of short-acting (SA) and
      long-acting (LA) opioids, and concurrent use with benzodiazepine or
      gabapentinoids. Additional variables included patients' age, sex, race, modified 
      Charlson Comorbidity Index score, mental health conditions, and medications for
      opioid use disorders. Factors associated with composite outcome and mortality
      were identified using Cox proportional hazards and reported as adjusted hazard
      ratio (aHR) and 95% CI. Factors associated with health care use were identified
      using Poisson regression and reported as adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) and
      95% CI. RESULTS: 1,328,287 opioid prescriptions were identified for 341,722
      patients. Opioid-related factors associated with the composite outcome,
      mortality, and hospitalizations, respectively, included opioid dosage (aHR 1.003 
      [95% CI 1.001-1.006]; aHR not applicable; aIRR 1.07 [1.06-1.08]), opioid days
      supply (aHR 1.03 [1.02-1.03]; aHR 1.009 [1.005-1.014]; aIRR 0.94 [0.92-0.96]),
      concurrent SA/LA opioids (aHR 2.12 [1.78-2.54]; aHR 1.40 [1.14-1.70]; aIRR 1.40
      [1.37-1.42]), and use of benzodiazepines/gabapentinoids (aHR 1.68 [1.38-2.04];
      aHR 1.23 [1.01-1.51]; aIRR 1.25 [1.23-1.27]). CONCLUSION: Many factors are
      associated with poor health outcomes, especially concurrent use of SA and LA
      opioids and overlapping prescriptions of opioids with benzodiazepines or
      gabapentinoids. Identification of factors associated with adverse outcomes may
      help identify patients at risk for poor outcomes and could inform possible
      interventions.

AB  - The introduction of bundled payment reimbursement focuses on rewarding efficient 
      and high-quality care. In order for bundled payment programs to be successful,
      collaboration across care settings is essential. Consequently, the introduction
      of this reimbursement program is expected to be associated with an increase of
      Health Information Exchange (HIE) among health providers. This paper aims at
      understanding how the use of HIE can be shaped by organization-specific factors
      such as trust, power, organizational culture, and leadership, especially when
      participating in bundled payment initiatives. The study was based on qualitative 
      semi-structured interviews with hospital administrators. Very diverse opinions
      arose from the interviewees, which leads to the main conclusion that policymakers
      should take into account differences between diverse hospital settings when
      adopting policies regarding technological innovations.

AB  - As a consequence of the epidemiological transition towards non-communicable
      diseases, integrated care approaches are required, not solely focused on medical 
      purposes, but also on a range of essential activities for the maintenance of the 
      individuals' quality of life. In order to allow the exchange of information,
      these integrated approaches might be supported by digital platforms, which need
      to provide trustful environments and to guarantee the integrity of the
      information exchanged. Therefore, together with mechanisms such as
      authentication, logging or auditing, the definition of access control policies
      assumes a paramount importance. This article focuses on the development of a
      parser as a component of a platform to support the care of community-dwelling
      older adults, the SOCIAL platform, to allow the definition of access control
      policies and rules using natural languages.

TI  - Standardized Data Structures in Rare Diseases: CDISC User Guides for Duchenne
      Muscular Dystrophy and Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 214-221
LID - 10.1111/cts.12845 [doi]
AB  - Interest in drug development for rare diseases has expanded dramatically since
      the Orphan Drug Act was passed in 1983, with 40% of new drug approvals in 2019
      targeting orphan indications. However, limited quantitative understanding of
      natural history and disease progression hinders progress and increases the risks 
      associated with rare disease drug development. Use of international data
      standards can assist in data harmonization and enable data exchange, integration 
      into larger datasets, and a quantitative understanding of disease natural
      history. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires the use of Clinical
      Data Interchange Consortium (CDISC) Standards in new drug submissions to help the
      agency efficiently and effectively receive, process, review, and archive
      submissions, as well as to help integrate data to answer research questions. Such
      databases have been at the core of biomarker qualification efforts and
      fit-for-purpose models endorsed by the regulators. We describe the development of
      CDISC therapeutic area user guides for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and
      Huntington's disease through Critical Path Institute consortia. These guides
      describe formalized data structures and controlled terminology to map and
      integrate data from different sources. This will result in increased
      standardization of data collection and allow integration and comparison of data
      from multiple studies. Integration of multiple data sets enables a quantitative
      understanding of disease progression, which can help overcome common challenges
      in clinical trial design in these and other rare diseases. Ultimately, clinical
      data standardization will lead to a faster path to regulatory approval of
      urgently needed new therapies for patients.

      How it Can Save Yours.
PG  - e16690

AB  - The internet holds the potential promise of improved patient outcomes, especially
      when one is faced with a critical or life-threatening disease or condition.
      Appropriate and timely access to health information can support informed
      negotiation of optimal treatments, optimal management, and expedited recovery,
      and to an improved outcome for a patient. However, there are many human and
      technical barriers that may prevent the application of the best possible
      information for both patient and provider alike, making the patient journey
      complex and potentially dangerous. In this viewpoint paper, the author (who is
      also a JMIR editor) reflects on a personal patient journey, where use of the
      internet facilitated a means of reaching a good patient outcome in the face of a 
      variety of informational and organizational limitations and gaps. This journey
      illustrates the importance of human-related factors affecting access to health
      information. The application of a range of internet information resources at
      critical points can result in a positive patient outcome, as this case
      illustrates. This paper reflects on how the experience highlights several
      information needs and concerns. It also highlights the need for improved access
      to appropriate health information along the patient journey that can support
      patient and provider joint decision-making. This access to information can make
      the difference between positive clinical outcomes and death, illustrating how
      health information on the internet can be both critical and life saving.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the Clinical Information
      Processing Instrument. This instrument attempts to examine information processing
      in electronic medical records (EMRs). We drew upon the theory of swift and even
      flow to guide survey development and construction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used
      a mixed-methods approach to gather data from registered nurses. Nurses were
      invited to participate in focus groups, an expert panel, and the survey
      validation process. A semi-structured questionnaire addressed the following
      themes: method of communication, quality of information, and usability of the
      system. RESULTS: We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using structural
      equation modelling. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was greater than 0.7 (0.90),
      and the Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (X(2) = 1519.03, df = 105, 
      P < 0.001). The proposed structural equation model was analysed and revised to a 
      final model that was statistically significant. The final survey, Clinical
      Information Processing Instrument, contained 18 Likert scale questions that
      supported the tenets of the theory of swift and even flow. DISCUSSION: The nurses
      perceived EMRs as efficient for medication management, time management, and
      communication. The Clinical Information Processing Instrument is a validated
      survey tool that assesses information flow in EMRs. CONCLUSIONS: The Clinical
      Information Processing Instrument was validated as an approach to analyse the
      utility of EMR in disseminating information among clinical staff. To increase the
      utility and meaningful use of EMR systems, it is important to consider factors
      that affect the distribution of information among clinicians.

AB  - Health information exchanges (HIEs) are multisided platforms that facilitate the 
      sharing of patient health information (PHI) between providers and payers across
      organizations within a region, community or hospital system. The benefits of HIEs
      to payers and providers include lower cost, faster services, and better health
      outcome. However, most HIEs have configured the patient healthcare consent
      process to give all providers who sign up with the exchange access to PHI for all
      consenting patients, leaving no control to patients in customized what
      information to share and with who. This research investigates the impact of
      granting greater control to patients in sharing their personal health information
      on consent rates and making them active participants in the HIEs system. This
      research utilizes a randomized experimental survey design study. The study uses
      responses from 388 participants and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test
      the conceptual model. The main findings of this research include that patients
      consent rate increases significantly when greater control in sharing PHI is
      offered to the patient. In addition, greater control reduces the negative impact 
      of privacy concern on the intention to consent. Similarly, trust in healthcare
      professionals leads to higher consent when greater control is offered to the
      patient. Thus, greater control empowers the role of trust in engaging patients
      and sustaining HIEs. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research by
      extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model.
      The findings impact practice by providing insights that will help sustain HIEs.

TI  - Does participation in health information exchange improve hospital efficiency?
PG  - 426-438
LID - 10.1007/s10729-017-9396-4 [doi]
AB  - The federal government allocated nearly $30 billion to spur the development of
      information technology infrastructure capable of supporting the exchange of
      interoperable clinical data, leading to growth in hospital participation in
      health information exchange (HIE) networks. HIEs have the potential to improve
      care coordination across healthcare providers, leading ultimately to increased
      productivity of health services for hospitals. However, the impact of HIE
      participation on hospital efficiency remains unclear. This dynamic prompts the
      question asked by this study: does HIE participation improve hospital efficiency.
      This study estimates the effect of HIE participation on efficiency using a
      national sample of 1017 hospitals from 2009 to 2012. Using a two-stage analytic
      design, efficiency indices were determined using the Malmquist algorithm and then
      regressed on a set of hospital characteristics. Results suggest that any
      participation in HIE can improve both technical efficiency change and total
      factor productivity (TFP). A second model examining total years of HIE
      participation shows a benefit of one and three years of participation on TFP.
      These results suggest that hospital investment in HIE participation may be a
      useful strategy to improve hospital operational performance, and that policy
      should continue to support increased participation and use of HIE. More research 
      is needed to identify the exact mechanisms through which HIE participation can
      improve hospital efficiency.

TI  - Barriers to exchanging healthcare information in inter-municipal healthcare
      services: a qualitative case study.
PG  - 92
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0701-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, inter-municipal cooperation in healthcare services
      has been an important measure implemented to meet future demographic changes in
      western countries. This entails an increased focus on communication and
      information sharing across organisational borders. Technology enables efficient
      and effective solutions to enhance such cooperation. However, the systems in the 
      healthcare sector tend not to communicate with one another. There is a lack of
      literature focusing on communication and information sharing in inter-municipal
      healthcare services. The aim of this article is to investigate both the
      characteristics of communication and information sharing, and the factors that
      serve as barriers to communication and information sharing for employees in
      inter-municipal healthcare services. METHODS: In this study, a qualitative case
      study approach is used to investigate both characteristics of communication and
      information sharing, and factors enabling barriers to communication and
      information sharing for employees in newly established inter-municipal healthcare
      services. Data collection methods were individual interviews, focus group
      interviews, observation studies and a workshop. A total of 18 persons
      participated in the study. The interviews, observations and workshop were
      conducted over a period of ten months. RESULTS: Communication and information
      sharing practices were found to be complex and characterised by multiple actors, 
      information types and a combination of multiple actions. Findings indicate that
      1. IT capability and usability 2. Differences 3. Privacy, confidentiality and
      security and 4. Awareness are all factors enabling barriers to communication and 
      information sharing in inter-municipal healthcare services. Specifically, these
      barriers were related to lack of EHR usability, inadequate workflow processes,
      digital systems incompatibility, the understanding of needs in different systems 
      and knowledge and practices regarding privacy and confidentiality. CONCLUSION: By
      focusing on the context of inter-municipal cooperation when assessing
      communication and information sharing in healthcare services, this article
      contributes to close a gap in existing knowledge. The perspective of the
      employees provides useful insight, and findings can be relevant for future theory
      development and for managers and policymakers in inter-municipal services.

TI  - Public Trust in Health Information Sharing: A Measure of System Trust.
PG  - 824-845
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.12654 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure public trust in a health information sharing in a broadly
      defined health system (system trust), inclusive of health care, public health,
      and research; to identify individual characteristics that predict system trust;
      and to consider these findings in the context of national health initiatives
      (e.g., learning health systems and precision medicine) that will expand the scope
      of data sharing. DATA SOURCES: Survey data (n = 1,011) were collected in February
      2014. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a composite index of four dimensions of system
      trust-competency, fidelity, integrity, and trustworthiness. The index was used in
      linear regression evaluating demographic and psychosocial predictors of system
      trust. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected by GfK Custom using a nationally
      representative sample and analyzed in Stata 13.0. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our
      findings suggest the public's trust may not meet the needs of health systems as
      they enter an era of expanded data sharing. We found that a majority of the U.S. 
      public does not trust the organizations that have health information and share it
      (i.e., the health system) in one or more dimensions. Together, demographic and
      psychosocial factors accounted for ~18 percent of the observed variability in
      system trust. Future research should consider additional predictors of system
      trust such as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs to inform policies and practices 
      for health data sharing.

TI  - Medical reliability of a video-sharing website: The gingival recession model.
PG  - 175-183
LID - 10.1111/eje.12417 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the quality of the scientific/clinical information in
      dentistry delivered by videos hosted by a popular video-sharing website. METHODS:
      The gingival recession condition was used as a model and YouTube as the video
      hosting service. A systematic observation of videos containing information on
      gingival recession was conducted. Videos were analysed to evaluate (i) the
      scientific reliability and quality of the information using Global Quality Scale 
      (GQS) and DISCREN criteria; and (ii) the understandability of this information
      using a tailor-made custom comprehensiveness index (CI). RESULTS: One hundred and
      eighty videos were identified. Videos dealing with surgical procedures were not
      included in the present review. After selection, 41 videos were analysed. The
      mean GQS was 2.34 on a 0-5 scale, and 25 (61%) videos showed clear aims according
      to DISCREN criteria. Misleading content was observed in eight videos (19.5%). The
      scientific sources of information were unclear in 26 (63.4%) videos. All videos
      failed to give additional references for supplemental information. Only three
      videos (7%) provided basic information on aetiology, clinical presentations and
      management of gingival recession. Based on 0-2 CI scores, three, nine and 29
      videos had a score of 2, 1 and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present model
      indicates that social media websites aiming to provide health information should 
      be carefully accounted, especially when dealing with dentistry. It also suggests 
      professional involvement to improve the quality of the delivered information.

AB  - Urgent care centers have been identified as one means of shifting care from
      high-cost emergency departments while increasing after-hours access to care.
      However, the episodic nature of urgent care also has the potential to fragment
      care. In this study, we examine the adoption of 2 coordination
      activities-referrals and the electronic exchange of health information-at urgent 
      care centers and other ambulatory providers across the United States. We find
      that setting is significantly associated with both health information exchange
      and referrals. Several organization-level variables and environment-level
      variables are also related to the propensity to coordinate care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE) systems are computer tools that
      healthcare providers use to share patients' medical information electronically.
      Our study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by general
      practitioners (GPs) when using an HIE system in the Canton of Ticino, a region in
      southern Switzerland. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using
      semi-structured interviews. Ten GPs participated in the study. We analysed
      transcripts using thematic content analysis and following an abductive approach
      (a mix of deductive and inductive approaches). RESULTS: Our findings indicate the
      following main facilitators of the HIE system: (a) the perception of having to do
      with a secure system; (b) the possibility of delegating its management to
      secretaries and healthcare assistants; (c) technical support and training; (d)
      high quality of the information exchanged; (e) positive impact on clinical
      practice; and (f) regional context. However, major challenges still persist, and 
      GPs reported the following main barriers to using an HIE system: (a) a frequent
      lack of all the patient documentation they needed; (b) no effective workflow
      improvements; and (c) lack of some technical features. CONCLUSIONS: The results
      of our study provide a qualitative perspective of opinions and experiences of GPs
      that can inform improvements of the current HIE system and future federal and
      cantonal HIE initiatives in Switzerland and elsewhere.

TI  - Falling short: how state laws can address health information exchange barriers
      and enablers.
PG  - 635-644
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx122 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Research on the implementation of health information exchange (HIE)
      organizations has identified both positive and negative effects of laws relating 
      to governance, incentives, mandates, sustainability, stakeholder participation,
      patient engagement, privacy, confidentiality, and security. We fill a substantial
      research gap by describing whether comprehensive state and territorial HIE legal 
      frameworks address identified legal facilitators and barriers. Materials and
      Methods: We used the Westlaw database to identify state and territorial laws
      relating to HIEs in effect on June 7, 2016 (53 jurisdictions). We blind-coded all
      laws and addressed coding discrepancies in peer-review meetings. We recorded a
      consensus code for each law in a master database. We compared 20 HIE legal
      attributes with identified barriers to and enablers of HIE activity in the
      literature. Results: Forty-two states, the District of Columbia, and 2
      territories have laws relating to HIEs. On average, jurisdictions address 8.32 of
      the 20 criteria selected in statutes and regulations. Twenty jurisdictions
      unambiguously address </=5 criteria in statutes and regulations. None of the
      significant legal criteria are unambiguously addressed in >60% of the 53
      jurisdictions. Discussion: Laws can be barriers to or enablers of HIEs. However, 
      jurisdictions are not addressing many significant issues identified by
      researchers. Consequently, there is a substantial risk that existing legal
      frameworks are not adequately supporting HIEs. Conclusion: The current evidence
      base is insufficient for comparative assessments or impact rankings of the
      various factors. However, the detailed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      dataset of HIE laws could enable investigations into the types of laws that
      promote or impede HIEs.

AB  - After more than a decade of investment in electronic health information exchange 
      (HIE), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
      is advancing a national framework-the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common
      Agreement-to connect islands of electronic data sharing. This national framework 
      creates new potential opportunities and challenges for state and local health
      information organizations (HIOs). We undertook our sixth national HIO survey to
      assess the current state of HIOs and to newly examine anticipated responses to
      the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement. We identified eighty-nine
      operational HIOs, down from 106 in 2014. Although more than half of HIOs
      struggled with financial viability and competition from health information
      technology vendor-based HIE networks, many are large in scale, offer a breadth of
      services to diverse participants, and engage in network-to-network connectivity. 
      Looking ahead, 56 percent of HIOs planned to participate in the Trusted Exchange 
      Framework and Common Agreement, and 41 percent were unsure. As the Trusted
      Exchange Framework and Common Agreement advances basic network-to-network
      connectivity, HIOs that have experience with such connectivity while also
      offering value-added services will be well positioned for sustainability and
      growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Public Private Interface-Electronic Patient Record (PPI-ePR)
      system was implemented as a new electronic platform to facilitate collaboration
      between the public and private sectors in Hong Kong. However, its barriers to
      participate and benefits have not been comprehensively assessed. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to evaluate the awareness, acceptance, perceived benefits, and
      obstacles to participation among private doctors and the general public. METHODS:
      From December 2012 to January 2013, 2435 telephone interviews were performed by
      trained interviewers to survey randomly selected patients who were enrolled or
      not enrolled in the PPI-ePR system. In addition, self-administered surveys were
      sent by postal mail to 4229 registered doctors in Hong Kong. The questionnaires
      for both patients and doctors contained questions on subjects' awareness,
      acceptance, and perceptions of the PPI-ePR, perceived benefits and obstacles of
      participating in the program, reasons for not using the system after enrolling,
      and perceived areas for service improvement of the system. RESULTS: More than
      53.1% (266/501) of enrolled patients believed that the PPI-ePR system would
      improve health care quality by reducing duplicate tests and treatments, while
      more than 76.8% (314/409) of enrolled doctors emphasized timely access to
      patients' medical records as the biggest benefit of their enrollment. Among
      nonenrolled patients, unawareness of the project was the most popular obstacle to
      enrolling in the PPI-ePR system (483/1200, 40.3%). Regarding nonenrolled doctors,
      the complicated registration process hindered them from participating in the
      program the most (95/198, 48.0%). Television, newspaper, and magazine
      advertisements and medical profession newsletters or journals were suggested as
      the most effective means to encourage participation in the program among surveyed
      patients (1297/1701, 76.2%) and doctors (428/610, 70.2%), respectively. Lack of
      clinical indication requiring data extraction from other hospitals was the main
      reason for low level of PPI-ePR use. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively
      assessed the popularity, perceived benefits, and hindering factors of enrolling
      in the PPI-ePR system in Hong Kong. Low levels of awareness, few privacy
      concerns, and inactive use of the PPI-ePR system were among the key features for 
      patients and physicians. Public promotions, simplified logistics, and a
      user-friendly online interface were suggested to improve the coverage and
      effectiveness of health information exchange between private and public health
      care sectors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Utilization of standard health information exchange (HIE) data is
      growing due to the high adoption rate and interoperability of electronic health
      record (EHR) systems. However, integration of HIE data into an EHR system is not 
      yet fully adopted in clinical research. In addition, data quality should be
      verified for the secondary use of these data. Thus, the aims of this study were
      to convert referral documents in a Health Level 7 (HL7) clinical document
      architecture (CDA) to the common data model (CDM) to facilitate HIE data
      availability for longitudinal data analysis, and to identify data quality levels 
      for application in future clinical studies. METHODS: A total of 21,492 referral
      CDA documents accumulated for over 10 years in a tertiary general hospital in
      South Korea were analyzed. To convert CDA documents to the Observational Medical 
      Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, processes such as CDA parsing, data cleaning,
      standard vocabulary mapping, CDA-to-CDM mapping, and CDM conversion were
      performed. The quality of CDM data was then evaluated using the Achilles Heel and
      visualized with the Achilles tool. RESULTS: Mapping five CDA elements (document
      header, problem, medication, laboratory, and procedure) into an OMOP CDM table
      resulted in population of 9 CDM tables (person, visit_occurrence,
      condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, measurement, observation,
      procedure_occurrence, care_site, and provider). Three CDM tables (drug_era,
      condition_era, and observation_period) were derived from the converted table.
      From vocabulary mapping codes in CDA documents according to domain, 98.6% of
      conditions, 68.8% of drugs, 35.7% of measurements, 100% of observation, and 56.4%
      of procedures were mapped as standard concepts. The conversion rates of the CDA
      to the OMOP CDM were 96.3% for conditions, 97.2% for drug exposure, 98.1% for
      procedure occurrence, 55.1% for measurements, and 100% for observation.
      CONCLUSIONS: We examined the possibility of CDM conversion by defining mapping
      rules for CDA-to-CDM conversion using the referral CDA documents collected from
      clinics in actual medical practice. Although mapping standard vocabulary for CDM 
      conversion requires further improvement, the conversion could facilitate further 
      research on the usage patterns of medical resources and referral patterns.

AB  - The medical knowledge sharing community provides users with an open platform for 
      accessing medical resources and sharing medical knowledge, treatment experience, 
      and emotions. Compared with the recipients of general commodities, the recipients
      in the medical knowledge sharing community pay more attention to the intensity or
      overall evaluation of emotional vocabularies in the comments, such as treatment
      effects, prices, service attitudes, and other aspects. Therefore, the overall
      evaluation is not a key factor in medical service comments, but the semantics of 
      the emotional polarity is the key to affect recipients of the medical
      information. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning emotion
      identification method (ALEIM) based on mutual information feature weight, which
      captures the correlation and redundancy of features. In order to evaluate the
      proposed method's effectiveness, we use four basic corpus libraries crawled from 
      the Haodf's online platform and employ Taiwan University NTUSD Simplified Chinese
      Emotion Dictionary for emotion classification. The experimental results show that
      our proposed ALEIM method has a better performance for the identification of the 
      low-frequency words' redundant features in comments of the online medical
      knowledge sharing community.

TI  - The Impact of a National Health Information Exchange Program Under a Single-payer
      System.
PG  - 90-97
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0000000000001227 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the PharmaCloud program, a 
      health information exchange program implemented in 2013, on medication
      duplication under a single-payer, universal health insurance program in Taiwan.
      STUDY DESIGN: This study employed a retrospective pre-post study design and used 
      nationwide health insurance claim data from 2013 to 2015. A
      difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of
      inquiry rate on the probability of receiving duplicate medications and on the
      number of days of overlapping medication prescriptions after implementation of
      the PharmaCloud program. RESULTS: The study subjects included patients receiving 
      medications in 7 categories: antihypertension drugs, 217,200; antihyperlipidemic 
      drugs, 69,086; hypoglycemic agents, 103,962; antipsychotic drugs, 15,479;
      antidepressant drugs, 12,057; sedative and hypnotic drugs, 56,048; and antigout
      drugs, 18,250. Up to 2015, the overall PharmaCloud inquiry rate has increased to 
      55.36%-69.16%. Compared with subjects in 2013, subjects in 2014 and 2015 had a
      significantly lower likelihood of receiving duplicate medication in all 7
      medication groups; for instance, for antihypertension drug users, the odds ratio 
      (OR) was 0.91 with 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.90-0.92 in 2014, and the OR was
      0.81 with 95% confidence interval=0.81-0.82 in 2015. However, a higher inquiry
      rate led to a lower likelihood of receiving duplicate medication and shorter
      periods of overlapping medications only in some of the medication groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: The health information exchange program has reduced medication
      duplication, yet the reduction was not entirely associated with record inquiries.
      The hospitals have responded to the challenge of medication duplication by
      enhancing internal prescription control via a prescription alert system, which
      may have contributed to the reduction in duplicate medications and is a positive,
      unintended consequence of the intervention.

      Model.
PG  - 510-529
LID - 10.1177/0733464817723565 [doi]
AB  - Improving communication during transitions from acute care hospitals into
      long-term post-acute care (LTPAC) settings is imperative for clinical staff to
      have the information they need to admit and care for the patient with accurate
      medical information provided in an efficient way. The research goals of this
      study are to examine the user experience of a new data sharing method, "Continued
      Access," a supplement to the standard summary of care, and to evaluate staff
      attitudes of the model on LTPAC residents' care. Clinical staff ( n = 20) from a 
      U.S. Midwestern LTPAC setting were interviewed to give their evaluation of the
      new model of data access, their concerns, and ways to improve the effectiveness
      of the model. Respondents reported better opportunities for quality care based on
      improved insight and clarity around patients' medical history, medications, and
      tests. Strategies for integrating Continued Access into the workflow and
      improving quality outcomes are discussed.

TI  - The Potential of Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange:
      Experimental Study From Patients' Perspectives.
PG  - e14184
LID - 10.2196/14184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, a number of mechanisms and tools are being used by health
      care organizations and physicians to electronically exchange the personal health 
      information of patients. The main objectives of different methods of health
      information exchange (HIE) are to reduce health care costs, minimize medical
      errors, and improve the coordination of interorganizational information exchange 
      across health care entities. The main challenges associated with the common HIE
      systems are privacy concerns, security risks, low visibility of system
      transparency, and lack of patient control. Blockchain technology is likely to
      disrupt the current information exchange models utilized in the health care
      industry. OBJECTIVE: Little is known about patients' perceptions and attitudes
      toward the implementation of blockchain-enabled HIE networks, and it is still not
      clear if patients (as one of the main HIE stakeholders) are likely to opt in to
      the applications of this technology in HIE initiatives. Thus, this study aimed at
      exploring the core value of blockchain technology in the health care industry
      from health care consumers' views. METHODS: To recognize the potential
      applications of blockchain technology in health care practices, we designed 16
      information exchange scenarios for controlled Web-based experiments. Overall,
      2013 respondents participated in 16 Web-based experiments. Each experiment
      described an information exchange condition characterized by 4 exchange
      mechanisms (ie, direct, lookup, patient-centered, and blockchain), 2 types of
      health information (ie, sensitive vs nonsensitive), and 2 types of privacy policy
      (weak vs strong). RESULTS: The findings show that there are significant
      differences in patients' perceptions of various exchange mechanisms with regard
      to patient privacy concern, trust in competency and integrity, opt-in intention, 
      and willingness to share information. Interestingly, participants hold a
      favorable attitude toward the implementation of blockchain-based exchange
      mechanisms for privacy protection, coordination, and information exchange
      purposes. This study proposed the potentials and limitations of a
      blockchain-based attempt in the HIE context. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this
      research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The findings 
      propose potential limitations of a blockchain-based HIE that should be addressed 
      by health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure 
      and private manner. This study can contribute to the research in the blockchain
      area and enrich the literature on the use of blockchain in HIE efforts.
      Practitioners can also identify how to leverage the benefit of blockchain to
      promote HIE initiatives nationwide.

TI  - E-health in Switzerland: The laborious adoption of the federal law on electronic

AB  - Within the framework of a broader e-health strategy launched a decade ago, in
      2015 Switzerland passed a new federal law on patients' electronic health records 
      (EHR). The reform requires hospitals to adopt interoperable EHRs to facilitate
      data sharing and cooperation among healthcare providers, ultimately contributing 
      to improvements in quality of care and efficiency in the health system. Adoption 
      is voluntary for ambulatories and private practices, that may however be pushed
      towards EHRs by patients. The latter have complete discretion in the choice of
      the health information to share. Moreover, careful attention is given to data
      security issues. Despite good intentions, the high institutional and
      organisational fragmentation of the Swiss healthcare system, as well as the lack 
      of full agreement with stakeholders on some critical points of the reform, slowed
      the process of adoption of the law. In particular, pilot projects made clear that
      the participation of ambulatories is doomed to be low unless appropriate
      incentives are put in place. Moreover, most stakeholders point at the strategy
      proposed to finance technical implementation and management of EHRs as a major

      mental disorders and physical diseases towards health information sharing.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Collecting, integrating, and sharing mental and
      physical health information can enhance the care process of patients and improve 
      the completeness of patient databases in the health information exchange (HIE)
      networks. There is a need to encourage patients with physical and mental
      disorders to share their health information with providers. Data entry interfaces
      are suggested as an important factor affecting the quality of information.
      However, little is known about whether individuals with different diseases
      (mental and physical) care for the data entry structure in sharing personal
      health information (PHI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conduct four experiments to
      examine the impact of different health problems (mental vs. physical) and types
      of data entry interfaces (structured vs. unstructured) on individuals'
      perceptions of information quality and their willingness to share their health
      information. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate that the type of disease and degree of
      data entry structure significantly influence individuals' perceptions of
      usefulness, accessibility, concise presentation, understandability, psychological
      risk, privacy concern, stigma, and willingness to share health information.
      DISCUSSION: People with mental disorders prefer structured data interfaces as
      they perceive that a high degree of data entry structure can protect their
      privacy and mitigate stigma and psychological risk more than unstructured
      interfaces. Individuals with physical illnesses favor structured interfaces for
      their format, which is brief, comprehensive, accessible, useful, and
      understandable. People suffering from physical diseases are more likely to share 
      their information when a highly-structured data entry interface is used.
      Moreover, individuals with mental disorders are less likely to disclose their
      information when providers collect health records using an unstructured data
      entry interface. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the best level of
      structure for data entry interfaces could be designed at the point of care
      consistent with patients' health status and their type of diseases to improve the
      success of HIE networks.

TI  - Patient and Consumer Safety Risks When Using Conversational Assistants for
      Medical Information: An Observational Study of Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
PG  - e11510
LID - 10.2196/11510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conversational assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant,
      are ubiquitous and are beginning to be used as portals for medical services.
      However, the potential safety issues of using conversational assistants for
      medical information by patients and consumers are not understood. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the prevalence and nature of the harm that could result from patients
      or consumers using conversational assistants for medical information. METHODS:
      Participants were given medical problems to pose to Siri, Alexa, or Google
      Assistant, and asked to determine an action to take based on information from the
      system. Assignment of tasks and systems were randomized across participants, and 
      participants queried the conversational assistants in their own words, making as 
      many attempts as needed until they either reported an action to take or gave up. 
      Participant-reported actions for each medical task were rated for patient harm
      using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality harm scale. RESULTS:
      Fifty-four subjects completed the study with a mean age of 42 years (SD 18).
      Twenty-nine (54%) were female, 31 (57%) Caucasian, and 26 (50%) were college
      educated. Only 8 (15%) reported using a conversational assistant regularly, while
      22 (41%) had never used one, and 24 (44%) had tried one "a few times." Forty-four
      (82%) used computers regularly. Subjects were only able to complete 168 (43%) of 
      their 394 tasks. Of these, 49 (29%) reported actions that could have resulted in 
      some degree of patient harm, including 27 (16%) that could have resulted in
      death. CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on conversational assistants for actionable medical 
      information represents a safety risk for patients and consumers. Patients should 
      be cautioned to not use these technologies for answers to medical questions they 
      intend to act on without further consultation from a health care provider.

TI  - Drivers of health information exchange use during postacute care transitions.
PG  - e7-e13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the drivers of the use of electronic health
      information exchange (HIE) by skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to access patient
      hospital data during care transitions. STUDY DESIGN: Explanatory, sequential
      mixed-methods study. Quantitative data from an audit log captured HIE use by 3
      SNFs to retrieve hospitalization information for the 5487 patients discharged to 
      their care between June 2014 and March 2017, along with patient demographic data.
      Qualitative inquiry included 16 interviews at the discharging hospital and
      HIE-enabled SNFs. METHODS: Multivariate probit models determined patient-level
      factors associated with SNF HIE use. These models informed subsequent in-depth,
      semistructured interviews to refine our understanding of usage patterns, as well 
      as facilitators of and barriers to use. RESULTS: HIE was used by SNFs for 46% of 
      patients for whom it was available; 29% of patients had records accessed within 3
      days of hospital discharge. Overall HIE use was more likely for new versus
      returning SNF patients (3.8%; P <.001) and when a patient was discharged from the
      emergency department rather than an inpatient unit (6.8%; P = .027). HIE use was 
      less likely on weekends (-4.3%; P = .036) and for more complex patients, as
      measured by length of stay (-0.4% per day; P </=.001) or number of conditions
      (-0.3% per diagnosis; P </=.001). Interviews revealed distinct HIE use cases
      across SNFs; perceiving ability to access information not otherwise available in 
      paper discharge materials, as well as workflow integration, were critical
      facilitators of use during transitional care. CONCLUSIONS: HIE between hospitals 
      and SNFs is underused. A mixed-methods approach is critical to understanding and 
      explaining variation in implementation and use. Creating value requires hospitals
      and SNFs to codevelop system design, usage guidelines, and workflows that
      meaningfully integrate HIE into care delivery.

TI  - Applying deep matching networks to Chinese medical question answering: a study
      and a dataset.
PG  - 52
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0761-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical and clinical question answering (QA) is highly concerned by
      researchers recently. Though there are remarkable advances in this field, the
      development in Chinese medical domain is relatively backward. It can be
      attributed to the difficulty of Chinese text processing and the lack of
      large-scale datasets. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a Chinese medical 
      QA dataset and proposes effective methods for the task. METHODS: We first
      construct a large scale Chinese medical QA dataset. Then we leverage deep
      matching neural networks to capture semantic interaction between words in
      questions and answers. Considering that Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) tools may
      fail to identify clinical terms, we design a module to merge the word segments
      and produce a new representation. It learns the common compositions of words or
      segments by using convolutional kernels and selects the strongest signals by
      windowed pooling. RESULTS: The best performer among popular CWS tools on our
      dataset is found. In our experiments, deep matching models substantially
      outperform existing methods. Results also show that our proposed semantic
      clustered representation module improves the performance of models by up to 5.5% 
      Precision at 1 and 4.9% Mean Average Precision. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we
      introduce a large scale Chinese medical QA dataset and cast the task into a
      semantic matching problem. We also compare different CWS tools and input units.
      Among the two state-of-the-art deep matching neural networks, MatchPyramid
      performs better. Results also show the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
      clustered representation module.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Health Care Information Technologies: Evaluation of Trust,
      Security Beliefs, and Privacy as Determinants of Health Care Outcomes.
PG  - e107
LID - 10.2196/jmir.9014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diffusion of health information technologies (HITs) within the
      health care sector continues to grow. However, there is no theory explaining how 
      success of HITs influences patient care outcomes. With the increase in data
      breaches, HITs' success now hinges on the effectiveness of data protection
      solutions. Still, empirical research has only addressed privacy concerns, with
      little regard for other factors of information assurance. OBJECTIVE: The
      objective of this study was to study the effectiveness of HITs using the DeLone
      and McLean Information Systems Success Model (DMISSM). We examined the role of
      information assurance constructs (ie, the role of information security beliefs,
      privacy concerns, and trust in health information) as measures of HIT
      effectiveness. We also investigated the relationships between information
      assurance and three aspects of system success: attitude toward health information
      exchange (HIE), patient access to health records, and perceived patient care
      quality. METHODS: Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed the data from a
      sample of 3677 cancer patients from a public dataset. We used R software (R
      Project for Statistical Computing) and the Lavaan package to test the
      hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: Our extension of the DMISSM to health care
      was supported. We found that increased privacy concerns reduce the frequency of
      patient access to health records use, positive attitudes toward HIE, and
      perceptions of patient care quality. Also, belief in the effectiveness of
      information security increases the frequency of patient access to health records 
      and positive attitude toward HIE. Trust in health information had a positive
      association with attitudes toward HIE and perceived patient care quality. Trust
      in health information had no direct effect on patient access to health records;
      however, it had an indirect relationship through privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS:
      Trust in health information and belief in the effectiveness of information
      security safeguards increases perceptions of patient care quality. Privacy
      concerns reduce patients' frequency of accessing health records, patients'
      positive attitudes toward HIE exchange, and overall perceived patient care
      quality. Health care organizations are encouraged to implement security
      safeguards to increase trust, the frequency of health record use, and reduce
      privacy concerns, consequently increasing patient care quality.

TI  - Legal Barriers to the Growth of Health Information Exchange-Boulders or Pebbles?
PG  - 110-143
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12313 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points: Historically, in addition to economic and technical hurdles, state
      and federal health information privacy laws have been cited as a significant
      obstacle to expanding electronic health information exchange (HIE) in the United 
      States. Our review finds that over the past decade, several helpful developments 
      have ameliorated the legal barriers to HIE, although variation in states' patient
      consent requirements remains a challenge. Today, health care providers'
      complaints about legal obstacles to HIE may be better understood as reflecting
      concerns about the economic and competitive risks of information sharing.
      CONTEXT: Although the clinical benefits of exchanging patients' health
      information electronically across providers have long been recognized,
      participation in health information exchange (HIE) has lagged behind adoption of 
      electronic health records. Barriers erected by federal and state health
      information privacy law have been cited as a leading reason for the slow
      progress. A comprehensive assessment of these issues has not been undertaken for 
      nearly a decade, despite a number of salient legal developments. METHODS:
      Analysis of federal and state health information privacy statutes and regulations
      and secondary materials. FINDINGS: Although some legal barriers to HIE persist,
      many have been ameliorated-in some cases, simply through improved understanding
      of what the law actually requires. It is now clear that the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act presents no obstacles to electronically
      sharing protected health information for treatment purposes and does not hold
      providers who properly disclose information liable for privacy breaches by
      recipients. The failure of federal efforts to establish a unique patient
      identifier number does slow HIE by inhibiting optimal matching of patient
      records, but other action to facilitate matching will be taken under the 21st
      Century Cures Act. The Cures Act also creates the legal architecture to begin to 
      combat "information blocking." Varying patient consent requirements under federal
      and state law are the most important remaining legal barrier to HIE progress.
      However, federal rules relating to disclosure of substance-abuse treatment
      information were recently liberalized, and development of a technical standard,
      Data Segmentation for Privacy, or DS4P, now permits sensitive data requiring
      special handling to be segmented within a patient's record. Even with these
      developments, state-law requirements for patient consent remain daunting to
      navigate. CONCLUSIONS: Although patient consent requirements make HIE
      challenging, providers' expressed worries about legal barriers to participating
      in HIE likely primarily reflect concerns that are economically motivated.
      Lowering the cost of HIE or increasing financial incentives may boost provider
      participation more than further reducing legal barriers.

TI  - Online Medical Record Nonuse Among Patients: Data Analysis Study of the 2019
      Health Information National Trends Survey.
PG  - e24767
LID - 10.2196/24767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Online medical records are being used to organize processes in
      clinical and outpatient settings and to forge doctor-patient communication
      techniques that build mutual understanding and trust. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to
      understand the reasons why patients tend to avoid using online medical records
      and to compare the perceptions that patients have of online medical records based
      on demographics and cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We used data from the Health
      Information National Trends Survey Cycle 3, a nationally representative survey,
      and assessed outcomes using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. The
      patients (N=4328) included in the analysis had experienced an outpatient visit
      within the previous 12 months and had answered the online behavior question
      regarding their use of online medical records. RESULTS: Patients who were
      nonusers of online medical records consisted of 58.36% of the sample (2526/4328).
      The highest nonuser rates were for patients who were Hispanic (460/683, 67.35%), 
      patients who were non-Hispanic Black (434/653, 66.46%), and patients who were
      older than 65 years (968/1520, 63.6%). Patients older than 65 years were less
      likely to use online medical records (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.84,
      P<.001). Patients who were White were more likely to use online medical records
      than patients who were Black (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.43-2.05, P<.001) or Hispanic (OR 
      1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, P<.001). Patients who were diagnosed with cancer were
      more likely to use online medical records compared to patients with no cancer (OR
      1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, P=.001). Among nonusers, older patients
      (>/=65 years old) preferred speaking directly to their health care providers (OR 
      1.76, 95% CI 1.35-2.31, P<.001), were more concerned about privacy issues caused 
      by online medical records (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22-2.66, P<.001), and felt
      uncomfortable using the online medical record systems (OR 10.55, 95% CI
      6.06-19.89, P<.001) compared to those aged 18-34 years. Patients who were Black
      or Hispanic were more concerned about privacy issues (OR 1.42, 1.09-1.84,
      P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Studies should consider social factors such as gender,
      race/ethnicity, and age when monitoring trends in eHealth use to ensure that
      eHealth use does not induce greater health status and health care disparities
      between people with different backgrounds and demographic characteristics.

      personal health record infrastructure.
PG  - 389-400
LID - 10.1177/1460458217712056 [doi]
AB  - One of the most significant changes in the healthcare field in the past 10 years 
      has been the large-scale digitalization of patients' healthcare data, and an
      increasing emphasis on the importance of patients' roles in cooperating with
      healthcare professionals through digital infrastructures. A project carried out
      in the North of Italy with the aim of creating a personal health record has been 
      evaluated over the course of 5 years by means of mixed method fieldwork. Two
      years after the infrastructure was put into regular service, the way in which
      patients are represented in the system and patient practices have been studied
      using surveys and qualitative interviews. The data show that, first, patients
      have become co-actors in describing their clinical histories; second, that they
      have become co-actors in the diagnosis process; and finally, they have become
      co-actors in the management of time and space as regards their specific state of 
      health.

TI  - Applying Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange and Persistent
      Monitoring for Clinical Trials.
PG  - 1167-1175
AB  - "Blockchain" is a distributed ledger technology originally applied in the
      financial sector. This technology ensures the integrity of transactions without
      third-party validation. Its functions of decentralized transaction validation,
      data provenance, data sharing, and data integration are a good fit for the needs 
      of health information exchange and clinical trials. We investigated the current
      workflow of Health Information Exchange and clinical trials; conducted design
      thinking processes with clinicians, trial managers, informaticians, and
      blockchain professionals; and implemented a private blockchain model to tackle
      known issues. We used coded Smart Contract regulations to simulate several
      scenarios in healthcare processes. This proof-of-concept work provides a feasible
      simulation for potential solutions to monitor clinical trials across different
      census regions persistently. Various levels of data access privileges have been
      designed to utilize a suite of customized Smart Contract settings. These settings
      emulate the workflow protocols for the monitoring entities, trial sponsors,
      clinical sponsors and participating subjects. Keywords: Blockchain, Smart
      Contract, Health Information Exchange, Clinical Trial, Persistent Monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are associated with inefficient and
      fragmented use of healthcare services. The Chesapeake Regional Information System
      for Our Patients, Inc. (CRISP) is a Health Information Exchange (HIE) linking
      disparate systems of care in the mid-Atlantic region. METHODS: This article
      describes applications of HIE for tracking hospital service utilization in
      substance use disorder clinical and services research, drawing upon data from one
      of the first studies approved to access the CRISP HIE. Participants were 200
      medical/surgical inpatients with comorbid opioid, cocaine, and/or alcohol use
      disorder (45.5 % female; 56.5 % black; 77.5 % opioid use disorder; 42.0 %
      homeless). This study compared HIE-identified hospital service utilization with
      conventional methods of participant self-report during in-person research
      follow-ups (3-, 6-, and 12-months post-discharge) and electronic health record
      (EHR) review from the hospital system of the index admission. RESULTS: This
      sample exhibited high levels of hospital utilization, which would have been
      underestimated using conventional methods. Relying exclusively on self-report in 
      the 12-month observation period would have identified only 33.8 % of 429
      inpatient hospitalizations and 9.0 % of 1,287 ED visits, due to both
      loss-to-follow-up and failure to report events. Even combining self-report with
      single-system EHR review identified only 66.2 % of inpatient hospitalizations and
      59.8 % of ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: CRISP HIE data were superior to conventional
      methods for ascertaining hospital service utilization in this sample of patients 
      exhibiting high-volume and fragmented care. The use of HIE holds implications for
      improving rigor, safety, and efficiency in research studies.

TI  - Exchanging Appointment Data Among Healthcare Institutions.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - The introduction of national electronic patient records such as the electronic
      patient dossier EPD in Switzerland provides a new basis for digitizing healthcare
      processes at a national level. One process however, that is currently neglected
      within the Swiss EPD, is the scheduling process in healthcare. The objective of
      this work is to analyze the appointment scheduling process and the involved IT
      systems in order to develop an appointment data structure and a concept for
      cross-institutional exchange of appointment data. The analysis showed that
      various outpatient and inpatient information systems support appointment booking 
      through proprietary solutions. A true standard for appointment data exchange is
      missing. We suggest an appointment data structure and a corresponding data
      exchange process based on the FHIR standard. In its current implementation, the
      Swiss EPD does not support this proposed appointment scheduling process. We
      discuss how potential additions such as the IHE Care Services Discovery (CSD)
      profile can provide better compatibility.

TI  - A Statewide Medication Management System: Health Information Exchange to Support 
      Drug Therapy Optimization by Pharmacists across the Continuum of Care.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1055/s-0037-1620262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While evidence generally supports the use of medication management
      technology, systems are typically implemented and evaluated piecemeal rather than
      as part of a comprehensive model for medication management. Systems to support
      drug therapy optimization, increasingly a key role of pharmacists in our
      healthcare system, have not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to
      describe the design, implementation, and use of health information technology to 
      support the hospital and community pharmacists' management of medications for
      high-risk patients statewide in the "Pharm2Pharm" model of care. Our aims were to
      make it easier for the pharmacists to access information needed to identify and
      resolve drug therapy problems using best practices for medication management and 
      communicate with other members of the care team. METHODS: The pharmacist's roles 
      and the medication management processes guided the design of the supporting
      technology, which was implemented after the Pharm2Pharm model was launched and
      the pharmacists' technology needs were assessed. Priorities for technology
      included sending care transition documents from hospital to community pharmacist 
      securely and efficiently, access to medical records, including medications and
      laboratory results, documentation, and patient tracking. Implementation and use
      of the technology were documented. RESULTS: Communications, medication
      management, and population management solutions were implemented to support the
      Pharm2Pharm model. The pharmacists delivering services through this model adopted
      and meaningfully used this technology to support their work. CONCLUSION:
      Implementing technology with value outside of the Pharm2Pharm model was a
      strategic approach to investment. This work emphasizes the importance of shifting
      the focus of technology from supporting a specific piece of the medication
      management process to supporting the goal of optimizing medication regimens.
      Health information exchange systems can provide important technology needed to
      integrate pharmacists into care teams as they are deployed to improve patient
      outcomes.

TI  - Impact of document consolidation on healthcare providers' perceived workload and 
      information reconciliation tasks: a mixed methods study.
PG  - 134-142
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy158 [doi]
AB  - Background: Information reconciliation is a common yet complex and often
      time-consuming task performed by healthcare providers. While electronic health
      record systems can receive "outside information" about a patient in electronic
      documents, rarely does the computer automate reconciling information about a
      patient across all documents. Materials and Methods: Using a mixed methods
      design, we evaluated an information system designed to reconcile information
      across multiple electronic documents containing health records for a patient
      received from a health information exchange (HIE) network. Nine healthcare
      providers participated in scenario-based sessions in which they manually
      consolidated information across multiple documents. Accuracy of consolidation was
      measured along with the time spent completing 3 different reconciliation
      scenarios with and without support from the information system. Participants also
      attended an interview about their experience. Perceived workload was evaluated
      quantitatively using the NASA-TLX tool. Qualitative analysis focused on
      providers' impression of the system and the challenges faced when reconciling
      information in practice. Results: While 5 providers made mistakes when trying to 
      manually reconcile information across multiple documents, no participants made a 
      mistake when the system supported their work. Overall perceived workload
      decreased significantly for scenarios supported by the system (37.2% in
      referrals, 18.4% in medications, and 31.5% in problems scenarios, P < 0.001).
      Information reconciliation time was reduced significantly when the system
      supported provider tasks (58.8% in referrals, 38.1% in medications, and 65.1% in 
      problem scenarios). Conclusion: Automating retrieval and reconciliation of
      information across multiple electronic documents shows promise for reducing
      healthcare providers' task complexity and workload.

TI  - Mining of Textual Health Information from Reddit: Analysis of Chronic Diseases
      With Extracted Entities and Their Relations.
PG  - e12876
LID - 10.2196/12876 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media platforms constitute a rich data source for natural
      language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, 
      and sentiment analysis. In particular, social media platforms about health
      provide a different insight into patient's experiences with diseases and
      treatment than those found in the scientific literature. OBJECTIVE: This paper
      aimed to report a study of entities related to chronic diseases and their
      relation in user-generated text posts. The major focus of our research is the
      study of biomedical entities found in health social media platforms and their
      relations and the way people suffering from chronic diseases express themselves. 
      METHODS: We collected a corpus of 17,624 text posts from disease-specific
      subreddits of the social news and discussion website Reddit. For entity and
      relation extraction from this corpus, we employed the PKDE4J tool developed by
      Song et al (2015). PKDE4J is a text mining system that integrates
      dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a highly
      flexible and extensible framework. RESULTS: Using PKDE4J, we extracted 2 types of
      entities and relations: biomedical entities and relations and
      subject-predicate-object entity relations. In total, 82,138 entities and 30,341
      relation pairs were extracted from the Reddit dataset. The most highly mentioned 
      entities were those related to oncological disease (2884 occurrences of cancer)
      and asthma (2180 occurrences). The relation pair anatomy-disease was the most
      frequent (5550 occurrences), the highest frequent entities in this pair being
      cancer and lymph. The manual validation of the extracted entities showed a very
      good performance of the system at the entity extraction task (3682/5151, 71.48%
      extracted entities were correctly labeled). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that
      people are eager to share their personal experience with chronic diseases on
      social media platforms despite possible privacy and security issues. The results 
      reported in this paper are promising and demonstrate the need for more in-depth
      studies on the way patients with chronic diseases express themselves on social
      media platforms.

TI  - Practice and market factors associated with provider volume of health information
      exchange.

LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the practice- and market-level factors associated with the
      amount of provider health information exchange (HIE) use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Provider and practice-level data was drawn from the Meaningful Use Stage 2 Public
      Use Files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Physician
      Compare National Downloadable File, and the Compendium of US Health Systems,
      among other sources. We analyzed the relationship between provider HIE use and
      practice and market factors using multivariable linear regression and compared
      primary care providers (PCPs) to non-PCPs. Provider volume of HIE use is measured
      as the percentage of referrals sent with electronic summaries of care (eSCR)
      reported by eligible providers attesting to the Meaningful Use electronic health 
      record (EHR) incentive program in 2016. RESULTS: Providers used HIE in 49% of
      referrals; PCPs used HIE in fewer referrals (43%) than non-PCPs (57%). Provider
      use of products from EHR vendors was negatively related to HIE use, while use of 
      Athenahealth and Greenway Health products were positively related to HIE use.
      Providers treating, on average, older patients and greater proportions of
      patients with diabetes used HIE for more referrals. Health system membership,
      market concentration, and state HIE consent policy were unrelated to provider HIE
      use. DISCUSSION: HIE use during referrals is low among office-based providers
      with the capability for exchange, especially PCPs. Practice-level factors were
      more commonly associated with greater levels of HIE use than market-level
      factors. CONCLUSION: This furthers the understanding that market forces, like
      competition, may be related to HIE adoption decisions but are less important for 
      use once adoption has occurred.

TI  - Advancing laboratory medicine in hospitals through health information exchange: a
      survey of specialist physicians in Canada.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/s12911-020-1061-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing occupies a prominent place in health care.
      Information technology systems have the potential to empower laboratory experts
      and to enhance the interpretation of test results in order to better support
      physicians in their quest for better and safer patient care. This study sought to
      develop a better understanding of which laboratory information exchange (LIE)
      systems and features specialist physicians are using in hospital settings to
      consult their patients' laboratory test results, and what benefit they derive
      from such use. METHODS: As part of a broader research program on the use of
      health information exchange systems for laboratory medicine in Quebec, Canada,
      this study was designed as on online survey. Our sample is composed of 566
      specialist physicians working in hospital settings, out of the 1512 physicians
      who responded to the survey (response rate of 17%). Respondents are
      representative of the targeted population of specialist physicians in terms of
      gender, age and hospital location. RESULTS: We first observed that 80% of the
      surveyed physicians used the province-wide interoperable electronic health
      records (iEHR) system and 93% used a laboratory results viewer (LRV) to consult
      laboratory test results and most (72%) use both systems to retrieve lab results. 
      Next, our findings reveal important differences in the capabilities available in 
      each type of system and in the use of these capabilities. Third, there are
      differences in the nature of the perceived benefits obtained from the use of each
      of these two systems. Last, the extent of use of an LRV is strongly influenced by
      the IT artefact itself (i.e., the hospital's LRV available capabilities) while
      the use of the provincial iEHR system is influenced by its organizational context
      (i.e. the hospital's size and location). CONCLUSIONS: The main contribution of
      this study lies in its insights into the role played by context in shaping
      physicians' choices about which laboratory information exchange systems to adopt 
      and which features to use, and the different perceptions they have about benefits
      arising from such use. One related implication for practice is that success of
      LIE initiatives should not be solely assessed with basic usage statistics.

AB  - Despite patient safety initiatives to improve care transitions, prior research
      largely neglects to elicit feedback from home health nurses regarding health
      information exchange. The goal of this quality improvement study was to identify 
      opportunities to facilitate information transfer during
      hospital-to-home-health-care transitions for older adults with heart failure. We 
      conducted focus groups with 19 nurses employed by a single healthcare system
      using two commercially available electronic health record (EHR) vendors. We
      analyzed interview transcripts following an immersion/crystallization approach to
      identify themes. Average participants were females in their mid-fifties with 15
      years of home health experience. Nurses reported challenges with
      hospital-to-home-health-care information exchange, specifically: 1) poor
      medication management, 2) ineffective communication, 3) technology issues, and 4)
      patient factors. Nurses identified several opportunities for improvement,
      including discordant EHR-generated medication lists, which may be amenable to
      technological solutions. Local quality improvement efforts should incorporate
      nurses' suggestions and leverage existing best practices.

TI  - Infertility influencers: an analysis of information and influence in the
      fertility webspace.
PG  - 1371-1378
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01799-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine fertility-related social media accounts and influencers on
      two social media platforms. METHODS: The search function of Twitter (TW) and
      Instagram (IG) was used to generate a list of accounts with the terms: fertility,
      infertility, ttc, egg freezing, ivf, endometriosis, and reproductive. Accounts
      not in English, in private, with no posts in > 1 year, or with content unrelated 
      to search terms were excluded. Accounts were assessed for author type; REI board 
      certification (REI-BC); influencer (INF) status (> 10 K followers on IG; verified
      check mark on TW); account demographics; and content in last 5 posts. Statistical
      analysis included unpaired t tests, a classification and regression tree (CART)
      analysis, and stepwise multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Seven hundred ten
      accounts were identified and 537 (278 TW, 259 IG) were included. Account types
      included societies, clinics, physicians, patients, groups, and "other." Instagram
      content (1290 posts reviewed) was primarily personal stories (31.7%) or
      inspiration/support (23.7%). Twitter content (1390 posts reviewed) was mostly
      promotion (28.2%) and research/education (20.2%). Thirty-nine accounts (12.5%)
      were influencers. Fertility influencers were most often awareness/support
      accounts (59.8% TW, 25.0% IG), patients (12.8% TW, 25% IG), or other (17.9% TW,
      21.0% IG). Only 7.7% TW and 7.1% IG INFs were board-certified REI physicians. The
      best predictor for classification as an influencer was high activity (> 50
      posts/month TW, > 10 posts/month IG). CONCLUSION: As patients increasingly
      utilize social media to obtain and engage with health information, it is critical
      to understand the fertility-related SM landscape. This understanding may help to 
      successfully enhance relationships with patients and ensure dissemination of
      accurate information.

TI  - End user information needs for a SMART on FHIR-based automated transfer form to
      support the care of nursing home patients during emergency department visits.
PG  - 1239-1248
AB  - Nursing home (NH) patients are extensive users of emergency department (ED)
      services. Problematically, poor information sharing and incomplete access to
      information complicates the delivery of care in EDs for NH patients. Paper-based 
      transfer forms can support information sharing, but have significant limitations.
      Standards-based automated transfer-forms that leverage health information
      exchange data may address the limitations of paper-based forms and better support
      care delivery. This study developed a prototype SMART on FHIR automated transfer 
      form for NH patients using priority data elements identified through individual
      interviews, a review of existing transfer forms, a targeted survey of end users, 
      and a design workshop. Analyses were grounded in the 5 Rights of clinical
      decision support framework. The most valuable data elements included: emergency
      contact/healthcare proxy, current medication list, reason for transfer to the ED,
      baseline neurological state, and relevant diagnoses / medical history. The
      working prototype was successfully deployed within an Amazon Web Service
      environment.

      (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperative Resources (FHIR) was applied according to
      standardized electronic medical record (EMR) storage. This infrastructure aims to
      facilitate rapid secondary use of EMR data in cross-institutional analyses on the
      basis of the Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange (SS-MIX),
      Japan's domestic standard for EMR export. Existing EMR storage comprised enormous
      numbers of HL7 v2 messages; therefore, the user interface and database structure 
      are basically defined according to the HL7 v2 data types and message structures, 
      causing difficulty in rapid extraction for researches by clinicians. To solve
      this problem, we are trying to enhance some user interface with HL7 FHIR, which
      needs SS-MIX items to be mapped through HL7 FHIR resources. We investigated
      definition gaps between HL7 FHIR and SS-MIX messages, and report a developed user
      interface with HL7 FHIR to query against existing storage.

TI  - Identification of Patients in Need of Advanced Care for Depression Using Data
      Extracted From a Statewide Health Information Exchange: A Machine Learning
      Approach.
PG  - e13809
LID - 10.2196/13809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the most commonly occurring form of mental illness worldwide,
      depression poses significant health and economic burdens to both the individual
      and community. Different types of depression pose different levels of risk.
      Individuals who suffer from mild forms of depression may recover without any
      assistance or be effectively managed by primary care or family practitioners.
      However, other forms of depression are far more severe and require advanced care 
      by certified mental health providers. However, identifying cases of depression
      that require advanced care may be challenging to primary care providers and
      health care team members whose skill sets run broad rather than deep. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to leverage a comprehensive range of patient-level diagnostic,
      behavioral, and demographic data, as well as past visit history data from a
      statewide health information exchange to build decision models capable of
      predicting the need of advanced care for depression across patients presenting at
      Eskenazi Health, the public safety net health system for Marion County,
      Indianapolis, Indiana. METHODS: Patient-level diagnostic, behavioral,
      demographic, and past visit history data extracted from structured datasets were 
      merged with outcome variables extracted from unstructured free-text datasets and 
      were used to train random forest decision models that predicted the need of
      advanced care for depression across (1) the overall patient population and (2)
      various subsets of patients at higher risk for depression-related adverse events;
      patients with a past diagnosis of depression; patients with a Charlson
      comorbidity index of >/=1; patients with a Charlson comorbidity index of >/=2;
      and all unique patients identified across the 3 above-mentioned high-risk groups.
      RESULTS: The overall patient population consisted of 84,317 adult (aged >/=18
      years) patients. A total of 6992 (8.29%) of these patients were in need of
      advanced care for depression. Decision models for high-risk patient groups
      yielded area under the curve (AUC) scores between 86.31% and 94.43%. The decision
      model for the overall patient population yielded a comparatively lower AUC score 
      of 78.87%. The variance of optimal sensitivity and specificity for all decision
      models, as identified using Youden J Index, is as follows: sensitivity=68.79% to 
      83.91% and specificity=76.03% to 92.18%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the
      ability to automate screening for patients in need of advanced care for
      depression across (1) an overall patient population or (2) various high-risk
      patient groups using structured datasets covering acute and chronic conditions,
      patient demographics, behaviors, and past visit history. Furthermore, these
      results show considerable potential to enable preventative care and can be easily
      integrated into existing clinical workflows to improve access to wraparound
      health care services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the
      greater need for information generated by bundled payment reimbursement and the
      use of Health Information Exchange (HIE). METHODS: The study is based on a
      secondary data analysis using theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) Healthcare
      IT Database and the AHA Annual Survey. A logistic regression was used to test the
      likelihood of hospitals participating in HIE if they were involved in bundled
      payment reimbursement. Negative binomial, ordered logistic and Poisson regression
      models were used to determine the associations between bundled payment
      reimbursement and health information sharing in terms of breadth, volume, and
      diversity, respectively. RESULTS: Hospitals in bundled payment programs were more
      likely to send and receive information through HIE and tosend information to
      different types of health providers but not to receive. They were also more
      likely to exchange different types of health information and to use HIE more
      often. CONCLUSIONS: The greater need for collaboration of hospitals participating
      in bundled payment programs was associated with greater information sharing among
      organizations through HIE, but different providers involved in the episode of
      care play different roles in HIE.

TI  - Rapid, Efficient Crowdsourcing Using Social Media for the Surgical Management of 
      Nephrolithiasis.
PG  - 872-876
LID - 10.1089/end.2019.0481 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The surgical management of nephrolithiasis can be challenging due
      to multiple appropriate and feasible approaches. One advantage of urologists'
      increasing social media use is the opportunity for crowdsourcing or aggregating
      feedback from remote participants. This study assesses the purposes and extent of
      online crowdsourcing by urologists for surgical stone disease. Methods: Twitter
      was queried with 22 stone-related keywords during a 60-day study period. All
      public posts were reviewed to identify crowdsourcing requests by urologists
      seeking clinical advice or feedback about surgical stone management. Content
      analysis of the crowdsourcing posts was performed by two reviewers to assess the 
      purposes of and responses to the requests. Results: A total of 399 posts linked
      to 29 crowdsourcing requests were analyzed. Crowdsourcing requests were answered 
      rapidly; the median time from initial post to final reply by participants was 2
      days. In the majority of requests, the author of the initial request posted a
      follow-up question or clarification, underscoring a bidirectional exchange of
      ideas. Most crowdsourcing engaged an international audience; requests originated 
      from 27 urologists in 12 countries, and all but one of the 29 requests (97%)
      received replies from users outside the origin country. Four purposes for
      crowdsourcing were observed: patient-specific surgical planning (206 posts, 52%);
      colleagues' experiences with a device or technique (86 posts, 22%); general
      advice about stone-related concerns (57 posts, 14%); and solutions to
      complications or quality improvement challenges (50 posts, 12%). Finally,
      protection of patient privacy appeared to be a concern; among the 17 (59%)
      crowdsourcing requests that were about individual patients or cases, all included
      patient-specific images or radiography, but none noted whether patient permission
      had been obtained. Conclusions: Social media crowdsourcing facilitates a range of
      general, patient-specific, and quality improvement challenges in surgical stone
      management. Participants should consider privacy concerns when publicly sharing
      imaging or patient data.

      Care.
PG  - 709-713
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190315 [doi]
AB  - Health information exchange (HIE) is seen as an essential technology for
      improving health care quality and efficiency by allowing exchange of
      patient-centered data over time and across organizations. The objective of this
      study was to evaluate the usage and the perceived usefulness of a nationwide HIE 
      in a centralized model that was implemented in 2013 in the province of Quebec,
      Canada. A mixed-method study was conducted with a longitudinal descriptive
      analysis of usage data combined with in-depth comparative case study in four
      selected primary care organizations and two emergency departments. Perceived
      benefits were reported by users across all dimensions of care performance,
      including accessibility, efficiency, quality and safety, and patient experience; 
      however, the experience of users was very heterogeneous and strongly associated
      with the commercial electronic record system available in their work place and
      the implementation strategy.

PG  - 529-535
LID - 10.1177/0733464820944043 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess whether the effects of a mobile predictive
      intervention used by Service Coordinators (SCs) reduce hospital utilization in a 
      Medicaid Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) population in Baltimore city
      during a 5-month intervention. SC participants (n = 11) were recruited to
      treatment or control groups. LTSS clients (n = 420) followed their SC
      randomization assignment. Utilization data were obtained from the Maryland
      Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) system and linked to service coordination records.
      Study groups were similar in age, gender, race, and years receiving LTSS. SCs'
      satisfaction with use of the mobile tool was surveyed. SC perceptions were
      neutral (mean scores ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 on a 5-point scale). No significant
      differences between groups were observed for all utilization metrics. The mobile 
      technology software system used in this study did not improve health care
      utilization for a LTSS population needing ongoing clinical and social services
      coordinated care.

AB  - Medical data are important in diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and medical
      accident investigation. The integrity and availability of medical data are the
      basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of
      medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At
      present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One
      way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control
      strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the
      patient's key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method
      is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem
      with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies
      during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the
      availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be
      reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and
      treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted
      and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the
      integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the
      sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses 
      the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the
      system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF 
      to a blockchain application.

      (HIE) mechanisms: an experimental study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Consumers' willingness to allow the distribution of their health data 
      is a prerequisite for the success of any health information exchange (HIE)
      initiative. Several mechanisms are being used by healthcare organizations to
      exchange health information electronically. Our goal is to investigate how
      patients' preferences regarding information exchange (i.e., privacy concern,
      opt-in intention, and perceived health information sensitivity) are affected by
      different HIE models and exchange architectures. METHODS: We designed a series of
      scenarios for controlled online experiments. Totally, 1416 respondents
      participated in seven experiments. Each experiment includes a separate scenario
      and 27 questions to measure outcome variables and demographics. Data were
      collected from a wide range of adult population in the U.S. and all the
      experiments were performed in English. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that
      there are significant differences in patients' perceptions of different HIE
      mechanisms in terms of privacy concern and opt-in intention. Consumers believe
      that the patient-controlled HIE at the regional level is the most preferred model
      to protect health information privacy and they are willing to opt-in to this
      model. However, there is no solid evidence to show that different HIE mechanisms 
      would affect the consumers' perceived health information sensitivity.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the importance of patient-controlled HIE models 
      that potentially enable patients to access, manage, integrate, and share their
      medical information with multiple healthcare organizations. The results show
      in-depth consumer adoption patterns across multiple HIE models and architectures 
      which are required to identify optimal approaches for HIE implementation using
      different exchange mechanisms.

TI  - Improving Notifiable Disease Case Reporting Through Electronic Information
      Exchange-Facilitated Decision Support: A Controlled Before-and-After Trial.
PG  - 401-410
LID - 10.1177/0033354920914318 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Outbreak detection and disease control may be improved by simplified, 
      semi-automated reporting of notifiable diseases to public health authorities. The
      objective of this study was to determine the effect of an electronic,
      prepopulated notifiable disease report form on case reporting rates by ambulatory
      care clinics to public health authorities. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year
      (2012-2014) controlled before-and-after trial of a health information exchange
      (HIE) intervention in Indiana designed to prepopulate notifiable disease
      reporting forms to providers. We analyzed data collected from electronic
      prepopulated reports and "usual care" (paper, fax) reports submitted to a local
      health department for 7 conditions by using a difference-in-differences model.
      Primary outcomes were changes in reporting rates, completeness, and timeliness
      between intervention and control clinics. RESULTS: Provider reporting rates for
      chlamydia and gonorrhea in intervention clinics increased significantly from
      56.9% and 55.6%, respectively, during the baseline period (2012) to 66.4% and
      58.3%, respectively, during the intervention period (2013-2014); they decreased
      from 28.8% and 27.5%, respectively, to 21.7% and 20.6%, respectively, in control 
      clinics (P < .001). Completeness improved from baseline to intervention for 4 of 
      15 fields in reports from intervention clinics (P < .001), although mean
      completeness improved for 11 fields in both intervention and control clinics.
      Timeliness improved for both intervention and control clinics; however, reports
      from control clinics were timelier (mean, 7.9 days) than reports from
      intervention clinics (mean, 9.7 days). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic, prepopulated case
      reporting forms integrated into providers' workflow, enabled by an HIE network,
      can be effective in increasing notifiable disease reporting rates and
      completeness of information. However, it was difficult to assess the effect of
      using the forms for diseases with low prevalence (eg, salmonellosis,
      histoplasmosis).

TI  - Health Information Exchange between Specialists and General Practitioners
      Benefits Rural Patients.
PG  - 564-572
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1731287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE) may improve diagnostic accuracy,
      treatment efficacy, and safety by providing treating physicians with expert
      advice. However, most previous studies on HIE have been observational in nature. 
      OBJECTIVES: To examine whether collaboration between specialists and general
      practitioners (GPs) in rural areas via HIE can improve outcomes among patients at
      low-to-moderate risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and stroke.
      METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, the Miyagi Medical and Welfare
      Information Network was used for HIE. We evaluated the clinical data of 1,092
      patients aged >/=65 years living in the rural areas of the Miyagi Prefecture and 
      receiving care from GPs only. High-risk patients were immediately referred to
      specialists, whereas low-to-moderate risk patients were randomly assigned to an
      intervention group in which GPs were advised by specialists through HIE (n = 518,
      38% male, mean age = 76 +/- 7 years) or a control group in which GPs received no 
      advice by specialists (n = 521, 39% male, mean age = 75 +/- 7 years). RESULTS: In
      the intention-to-treat analysis, all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of 
      serious adverse events (e.g., hospital admission or unexpected referral to
      specialists) did not differ between the groups. However, per-protocol analysis
      controlling for GP adherence with specialist recommendations revealed
      significantly reduced all-cause mortality (p = 0.04) and cumulative serious
      adverse event incidence (p = 0.04) in the intervention group compared with the
      control group. CONCLUSION: HIE systems may improve outcomes among low-to-moderate
      risk patients by promoting greater collaboration between specialists and GPs,
      particularly in rural areas with few local specialists.

      From Florida Hospitals.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05447 [doi]
AB  - Achieving widespread exchange of health information is a national health policy
      objective, for it is believed to boost treatment efficiency, reduce health care
      costs, and improve patient outcomes. We used state-level data for 2011-14 from
      Florida to examine the relationship between hospitals' participation in health
      information exchange (HIE) and quality and health outcomes. HIE participation was
      associated with a decrease in the probability of unplanned, thirty-day
      readmissions for acute myocardial infarction that was 1.3 percentage points
      greater than that seen at nonparticipating hospitals. This decrease was driven
      primarily by reduced readmissions to hospitals other than those that provided
      initial inpatient treatment. These findings indicate that HIE can be leveraged to
      improve quality measures targeted by the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program 
      and may hold promise for achieving broader policy goals.

TI  - Long-term evaluation of a hospital-based violence intervention program using a
      regional health information exchange.
PG  - 175-182
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001671 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIP) aim to reduce
      violent-injury recidivism by providing intensive case management services to
      high-risk patients who were violently injured. Although HVIP have been found
      effective at reducing recidivism, few studies have sought to identity how long
      their effects last. Additionally, prior studies have been limited by the fact
      that HVIP typically rely on self-report or data within their own healthcare
      system to identify new injuries. Our aim was to quantify the long-term recidivism
      rate of participants in an HVIP program using more objective and comprehensive
      data from a regional health information exchange. METHODS: The study included 328
      patients enrolled in Prescription for Hope (RxH), an HVIP, between January 2009
      and August 2016. We obtained RxH participants' emergency department (ED)
      encounter data from a regional health information exchange database from the date
      of hospital discharge to February 2017. Our primary outcome was violent-injury
      recidivism rate of the RxH program. We also examined reasons for ED visits that
      were unrelated to violent injury. RESULTS: We calculated a 4.4% recidivism rate
      based on 8 years of statewide data, containing 1,575 unique encounters. More than
      96% of participants were matched in the state database. Of the 15 patients who
      recidivated, only five were admitted for their injury. More than half of new
      violence-related injuries were treated outside of the HVIP-affiliated trauma
      center. The most common reasons for ED visits were pain (718 encounters),
      followed by suspected complications or needing additional postoperative care (181
      encounters). Substance abuse, unintentional injuries, and suicidal ideation were 
      also frequent reasons for ED visits. CONCLUSION: The low, long-term recidivism
      rate for RxH indicates that HVIPs have enduring positive effects on the majority 
      of participants. Our results suggest that HVIP may further benefit patients by
      partnering with organizations that work to prevent suicide, substance use
      disorders, and other unintentional injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic
      study, level III.

AB  - Nurses report significant gaps in communication among patients discharged from
      the hospital with home healthcare (HHC) services. The aim of this pilot study was
      to quantify the contents of HHC admission packets used to guide nurses' first
      home visit after hospital discharge. We evaluated 20 randomly selected charts of 
      older adults admitted to HHC after a hospitalization for heart failure. Admission
      packets contained nearly 50 pages of material, which frequently included
      duplicate documents printed from the hospital-based electronic health record
      (EHR). Despite the plethora of documents, most packets omitted key information,
      such as patients' cognitive and functional status, and even discharge summaries, 
      which would be relevant and actionable for HHC nurses. Moreover, admission
      packets contained multiple, often discordant, EHR-generated medication lists,
      which makes reconciliation challenging for nurses and puts vulnerable patients at
      risk for adverse drug events. Overall, there is an urgent need to improve health 
      information exchange between hospitals and HHC agencies, which will
      simultaneously promote nurse efficiency and patient safety.

TI  - Human-centered development of an electronic health record-embedded, interactive
      information visualization in the emergency department using fast healthcare
      interoperability resources.
PG  - 1401-1410
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate an interactive information visualization embedded
      within the electronic health record (EHR) by following human-centered design
      (HCD) processes and leveraging modern health information exchange standards.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied an HCD process to develop a Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application that displays a patient's asthma
      history to clinicians in a pediatric emergency department. We performed a
      preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number
      of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction,
      and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality 
      were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end
      users. RESULTS: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated
      a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P < .001), number of
      screens (P < .001), and cognitive load (P < .001) for clinicians when compared to
      base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable
      functionality and high user satisfaction. DISCUSSION: Following HCD processes to 
      develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement 
      is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges
      associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as
      currently implemented. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our
      visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of
      pediatric asthma patients. Application development efforts in an operational
      context should leverage existing health information exchange standards, such as
      FHIR, and evidence-based mixed methods approaches.

TI  - Potential of technology to improve the availability and use of health information
      on cancer subjects for clergy from rural communities.
PG  - 35-47
LID - 10.1111/hir.12275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and often is a
      chronic long term disease. This calls for an expanded workforce to include
      non-traditional health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To determine effectiveness of a
      cancer information training project with clergy from selected rural Appalachian
      areas to improve comfort and willingness to work as part of the cancer health
      care team. METHODS: Clergy were trained in the consumer health database of the
      National Library of Medicine MedlinePlus.gov. Exercises were required that were
      done using an iPad tablet with an online curriculum. They were also taught how to
      do a population health assessment of their particular area and develop a health
      ministry for their church. RESULTS: Three key elements were confirmed that would 
      enable replication of the pilot: access to medlineplus, programmed learning
      modules using mobile technology such as iPads, and staff support including
      librarians and medical staff. With these key elements, the cancer project is
      potentially replicable with other groups beyond clergy. CONCLUSION: Knowledge
      about population health, built on new awareness and topical health knowledge, and
      using new skills to identify relevant information and library resources, could
      open minds and enhance community support for preventive and medical
      interventions.

AB  - The study's aim was to extend descriptions of how older patients with granted
      eHomecare and their relatives understand safety, and further to describe how they
      experience safety in everyday life. The study was conducted in Sweden. The
      participants were 12 older patients who had been provided with eHomecare and 8
      relatives. Data were collected by semi-structured individual interviews. A
      conceptual framework of safety was used and a qualitative content analysis was
      conducted in a deductive and an inductive phase. The deductive results are
      presented in predefined categories: perceived sense of safety, disturbance and
      threats, re-establishing safety, and new safety. The inductive analysis resulted 
      in two main categories: safety as part of everyday life and eHomecare as safety. 
      The results show that eHomecare can promote safety for older patients and their
      relatives. Existing doubts and ethical concerns about the service can be
      minimized by providing adequate information.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although a national Personal Health Record (PHR) infrastructure was
      supposed to have been introduced in Germany by law in 2006 and different
      providers are entering the market, no system has yet been widely adopted in
      Germany. There is also little information available on how current technical
      advancements affect German patients' and physicians' trust in PHR systems.
      METHODS: Supporting scenarios obtained from clinicians, this study proposes a
      concept for a German PHR system using a public cloud infrastructure, smartphone
      access and focusing on trust, privacy, and interoperability. In advance to an
      eventual implementation, a multi-center questionnaire study has been conducted to
      predict patients' and physicians' intention to use that system and evaluate their
      trust in different providers of such a system. RESULTS: Our results show that
      both patients and physicians are highly likely to use the PHR based on the
      present concept. Trust in healthcare providers exceeds trust in other
      institutions like private companies, health insurance companies, or even
      governmental institutions when offering such a PHR system. CONCLUSIONS: We
      recommend the implementation of this PHR system. To maximize patients' and
      physicians' trust in the system, it should be offered to patients by their
      healthcare provider. Further evaluation regarding its actual adoption and
      expected improvement in patient outcome based on the scenarios is advisable.

TI  - Electronic patient agenda forms: comparing agreement between the reason for
      specialty consultation reported by referring providers and patients.
PG  - 105-113
LID - 10.1080/17538157.2018.1437041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the agreement between referring providers'
      reason for specialty evaluation and patients' understanding of why they are
      referred for consultation. Here, we compared the reason for consult (RFC)
      documented by referring providers during usual care vs. the perceived RFC
      independently reported by patients through an e-portal just prior to the
      specialist visit. METHODS: We performed an observational study among patients
      referred for gastrointestinal (GI) evaluation. Patients referred to the specialty
      clinic submitted their self-reported RFC using an online patient agenda form
      prior to their visit. Therefore, each participant had a referring provider- and
      patient-documented RFC. Blinded physicians reviewed the RFCs in random order
      using a priori coding criteria. We then compared whether the provider and patient
      RFC pairs were concordant (i.e., >/=1 clinical topic[s] in the RFCs matched).
      RESULTS: Sixty patients completed the e-portal prior to their visit, leading to
      60 provider-patient RFC pairs. The RFC pairs were concordant in only 52% of
      cases. CONCLUSIONS: There is poor agreement between referring providers' reason
      for GI referral and patients' understanding of why they are visiting the clinic. 
      Future research examining whether electronic patient agenda forms impact
      diagnostic and management precision, patient satisfaction, and healthcare
      utilization is warranted.

TI  - Health-related Google searches performed by parents of pediatric oncology
      patients.
PG  - e27795
LID - 10.1002/pbc.27795 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the specific information parents of children
      with cancer search for online. Understanding the content of parents' searches
      over time could offer insight into what matters most to parents and identify
      knowledge gaps that could inform more comprehensive approaches to family
      education and support. METHODS: We describe parents' health-related Google
      searches starting six months before cancer diagnosis and extending through the
      date of study enrollment, which was at least one month after initiating cancer
      treatment. Searches were obtained retrospectively and grouped into health-related
      and non-health-related categories. The median time to parent enrollment from date
      of cancer diagnosis was 264 days. RESULTS: Parents searched for health-related
      topics more frequently than the general population (13% vs 5%). Health-related
      searches increased in the months preceding the child's cancer diagnosis and most 
      commonly pertained to symptoms and logistics, "directions to hospital."
      Health-related search volume peaked about a month after cancer diagnosis when
      general health-related searches were present in addition to cancer-specific
      searches. Eighteen percent of health-related searches were cancer specific, and
      of these cancer-specific searches, 54% pertained to support, for example "cancer 
      quote for son." CONCLUSIONS: Google search content offers insight into what
      matters to parents of cancer patients. Understanding search content could inform 
      more comprehensive approaches to family education and support initiatives.

TI  - An Assessment of Information Exchange Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities to
      Support US Disease Surveillance in 3 States.
PG  - 546-553
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000000625 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: State and local public health agencies collect and use surveillance
      data to identify outbreaks, track cases, investigate causes, and implement
      measures to protect the public's health through various surveillance systems and 
      data exchange practices. PURPOSE: The purpose of this assessment was to better
      understand current practices at state and local public health agencies for
      collecting, managing, processing, reporting, and exchanging notifiable disease
      surveillance information. METHODS: Over an 18-month period (January 2014-June
      2015), we evaluated the process of data exchange between surveillance systems,
      reporting burdens, and challenges within 3 states (California, Idaho, and
      Massachusetts) that were using 3 different reporting systems. RESULTS: All 3
      states use a combination of paper-based and electronic information systems for
      managing and exchanging data on reportable conditions within the state. The flow 
      of data from local jurisdictions to the state health departments varies
      considerably. When state and local information systems are not interoperable,
      manual duplicative data entry and other work-arounds are often required. The
      results of the assessment show the complexity of disease reporting at the state
      and local levels and the multiple systems, processes, and resources engaged in
      preparing, processing, and transmitting data that limit interoperability and
      decrease efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Through this structured assessment, the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a better understanding of the
      complexities for surveillance of using commercial off-the-shelf data systems
      (California and Massachusetts), and CDC-developed National Electronic Disease
      Surveillance System Base System. More efficient data exchange and use of data
      will help facilitate interoperability between National Notifiable Diseases
      Surveillance Systems.

TI  - Health systems' use of enterprise health information exchange vs single
      electronic health record vendor environments and unplanned readmissions.
PG  - 989-998
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz116 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enterprise health information exchange (HIE) and a single electronic
      health record (EHR) vendor solution are 2 information exchange approaches to
      improve performance and increase the quality of care. This study sought to
      determine the association between adoption of enterprise HIE vs a single vendor
      environment and changes in unplanned readmissions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      association between unplanned 30-day readmissions among adult patients and
      adoption of enterprise HIE or a single vendor environment was measured in a panel
      of 211 system-member hospitals from 2010 through 2014 using fixed-effects
      regression models. Sample hospitals were members of health systems in 7 states.
      Enterprise HIE was defined as self-reported ability to exchange information with 
      other members of the same health system who used different EHR vendors. A single 
      EHR vendor environment reported exchanging information with other health system
      members, but all using the same EHR vendor. RESULTS: Enterprise HIE adoption was 
      more common among the study sample than EHR (75% vs 24%). However, adoption of a 
      single EHR vendor environment was associated with a 0.8% reduction in the
      probability of a readmission within 30 days of discharge. The estimated impact of
      adopting an enterprise HIE strategy on readmissions was smaller and not
      statically significant. CONCLUSION: Reductions in the probability of an unplanned
      readmission after a hospital adopts a single vendor environment suggests that HIE
      technologies can better support the aim of higher quality care. Additionally,
      health systems may benefit more from a single vendor environment approach than
      attempting to foster exchange across multiple EHR vendors.

TI  - Integrating patient perspectives in medical decision-making: a qualitative
      interview study examining potentials within the rare disease information exchange
      process in practice.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0911-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many European countries have recently implemented national rare
      disease plans. Although the network is strengthening, especially on the macro and
      meso levels, patients still go a long way through healthcare systems, with many
      health professionals involved and scarce evidence to gather. Specifically,
      patient involvement in the form of shared decision-making can offer further
      potential to increase healthcare systems' efficiency on a micro level. Therefore,
      we examine the implementation of the shared decision-making concept thus far, and
      explore whether efficiency potentials exist-which are particularly relevant
      within the rare disease field-and how they can be triggered. METHODS: Our
      empirical evidence comes from 101 interviews conducted from March to September
      2014 in Germany; 55 patients, 13 family members, and 33 health professionals
      participated in a qualitative interview study. Transcripts were analyzed using a 
      directed qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The interviews indicate that the 
      decision-making process is increasingly relevant in practice. In comparison,
      however, the shared decision-making agreement itself was rarely reported. A
      majority of interactions are dominated by individual, informed decision-making,
      followed by paternalistic approaches. The patient-physician relationship was
      characterized by a distorted trust-building process, which is affected by not
      only dependencies due to the diseases' severity and chronic course, but an
      often-reported stigmatization of patients as stimulants. Moreover, participation 
      was high due to a pronounced engagement of those affected, diminishing as
      patients' strength vanish during their odyssey through health care systems. The
      particular roles of "expert patients" or "lay experts" in the rare disease field 
      were revealed, with further potential in integrating the gathered information.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals the named efficiency potentials, which are unique 
      for rare diseases and make the further integration of shared decision-making very
      attractive, facilitating diagnostics and disease management. It is noteworthy
      that integrating shared decision-making in the rare disease field does not only
      require strengthening the position of patients but also that of physicians.
      Efforts can be made to further integrate the concept within political frameworks 
      to trigger the identified potential and assess the health-economic impact.

TI  - Accessing and sharing health information for post-discharge stroke care through a
      national health information exchange platform - a case study.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0816-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients and citizens need access to their health information to get 
      a retrospective as well as a prospective view on their care and rehabilitation
      processes. However, patients' health information is stored in several health
      information systems and interoperability problems often hamper accessibility. In 
      Sweden a national health information exchange (HIE) platform has been developed
      that enables information exchange between different health information systems.
      The aim of this study is to explore the opportunities and limitations of
      accessing and interacting with important health information through the Swedish
      national HIE platform. METHODS: A single case study approach was used for this
      study as an in-depth understanding of the subject was needed. A fictive patient
      case with a pseudo-name was created based on an interview with a stroke
      coordinator in Stockholm County. Information access through the national health
      information exchange platform and available service contracts and application
      programming interfaces were studied using different scenarios. RESULTS: Based on 
      the scenarios created in this study, patients would be able to access some health
      related information from their electronic health records using the national
      health information exchange platform. However, there is necessary information
      which is not retrievable as it is either stored in electronic health records and 
      eHealth services which are not connected to the national health information
      exchange platform or there is no service contract developed for these types of
      information. In addition, patients are not able to share information with
      healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The national Swedish HIE platform provides 
      the building blocks needed to allow patients online access to their health
      information in a fragmented and distributed health system. However, more complex 
      interaction scenarios allowing patients to communicate with their health care
      providers or to update their health related information are not yet supported.
      Therefore it is of great importance to involve patients throughout the design and
      evaluation of eHealth services on both national and local levels to ensure that
      their needs for interoperability and information exchange are met.

TI  - Semantics Management for a Regional Health Information System in Italy by CTS2
      and FHIR.
PG  - 119-123
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210828 [doi]
AB  - An infrastructure for the management of semantics is being developed to support
      the regional health information exchange in Veneto - an Italian region which has 
      about 5 million inhabitants. Terminology plays a key role in the management of
      the information fluxes of the Veneto region, in which the management of
      electronic health record is given great attention. An architecture for the
      management of the semantics of laboratory reports has been set up, adopting
      standards by HL7. The system has been initially developed according to the common
      terminology service release 2 (CTS2) standard and, in order to overcome
      complexities of CTS2 is being revised according to the Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which has been subsequently
      introduced. Aspects of CST2 and of FHIR have been considered in order to retain
      most suitable aspects of both. This integration can be regarded as most
      worthwhile.

TI  - Securing electronic medical record in Near Field Communication using Advanced
      Encryption Standard (AES).
PG  - 357-362
LID - 10.3233/THC-171140 [doi]
AB  - Doctors usually require patients' medical records before medical examinations.
      Nevertheless, obtaining such records may take time. Hence, Near Field
      Communication (NFC) could be used to store and send medical records between
      doctors and patients. Another issue is that there could be a threat such as, Man 
      In The Middle Attack and eavesdropping, thus, a security method is required to
      secure the data. Furthermore, the information regarding the key and
      initialisation vector in NFC cannot be sent using one data package, hence, the
      data transmission should be done several times. Therefore, the initialisation
      vector that changed in each transmission is implemented, and the key utilised is 
      based on the component agreed by both parties. This study aims at applying the
      cryptography process that does disturb and hinder the speed of data transmission.
      The result demonstrated that the data transmitted could be secured and the
      encryption process did not hinder data exchange. Also, different number of
      characters in plaintexts required different amount of time for encryption and
      decryption. It could be affected by the specifications of the devices used and
      the processes happening in the devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media has provided an online environment for patients to
      discuss regarding their health and seek medical information. The primary aim of
      our study was to analyze the quality of information shared on YouTube regarding
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). RESULTS: More than half of the
      videos, 91 (57.23%) had duration of fewer than 5 min. Only 8 (5.03%) videos were 
      rated as highly useful whereas 61 (38.36%) videos were misleading. Interestingly,
      there was a significant higher (1203.38 +/- 395) likes in the misleading group of
      videos, compared to 162.13 +/- 169.63 likes in the very useful group, P = 0.012. 
      Only a small fraction of videos had very useful information on ADHD. There is a
      need for high-quality, evidence-based, educational videos on ADHD for patient
      education.

TI  - A Secure Protocol for Managing and Sharing Personal Healthcare Data.
PG  - 92-96
LID - 10.3233/SHTI200701 [doi]
AB  - Current technologies provide the ability to healthcare practitioners and
      citizens, to share and analyse healthcare information, thus improving the patient
      care quality. Nevertheless, European Union (EU) citizens have very limited
      control over their own health data, despite that several countries are using
      national or regional Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for realizing virtual or
      centralized national repositories of citizens' health records. Health Information
      Exchange (HIE) can greatly improve the completeness of patients' records.
      However, most of the current researches deal with exchanging health information
      among healthcare organizations, without giving the ability to the citizens on
      accessing, managing or exchanging healthcare data with healthcare organizations
      and thus being able to handle their own data, mainly due to lack of
      standardization and security protocols. Towards this challenge, in this paper a
      secure Device-to-Device (D2D) protocol is specified that can be used by software 
      applications, aiming on facilitating the exchange of health data among citizens
      and healthcare professionals, on top of Bluetooth technologies.

TI  - Bouncing Back Elsewhere: Multilevel Analysis of Return Visits to the Same or a
      Different Hospital After Initial Emergency Department Presentation.
PG  - 555-563.e1
LID - S0196-0644(17)31488-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.08.023 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Analyses of 72-hour emergency department (ED) return visits are 
      frequently used for quality assurance purposes and have been proposed as a means 
      of measuring provider performance. These analyses have traditionally examined
      only patients returning to the same hospital as the initial visit. We use a
      health information exchange network to describe differences between ED visits
      resulting in 72-hour revisits to the same hospital and those resulting in
      revisits to a different site. METHODS: We examined data from a 31-hospital health
      information exchange of all ED visits during a 5-year period to identify 72-hour 
      return visits and collected available encounter, patient, and hospital variables.
      Next, we used multilevel analysis of encounter-level, patient-level, and
      hospital-level data to describe differences between initial ED visits resulting
      in different-site and same-site return visits. RESULTS: We identified 12,621,159 
      patient visits to the 31 study EDs, including 841,259 same-site and 107,713
      different-site return visits within 72 hours of initial ED presentation. We
      calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
      initial-visit characteristics' predictive relationship that any return visit
      would be at a different site: daytime visit (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.12),
      patient-hospital county concordance (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.44), male sex (OR 
      1.27; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.30), aged 65 years or older (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.53 to
      0.57), sites with an ED residency (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.43), sites at an
      academic hospital (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.15), sites with high density of
      surrounding EDs (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.68 to 1.77), and sites with a high frequency
      of same-site return visits (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.11). CONCLUSION: This
      analysis describes how ED encounters with early revisits to the same hospital
      differ from those with revisits to a second hospital. These findings challenge
      the use of single-site return-visit frequency as a quality measure, and, more
      constructively, describe how hospitals can use health information exchange to
      more accurately identify early ED return visits and to support programs related
      to these revisits.

TI  - Health information exchange use during dental visits.
PG  - 1210-1219
AB  - Dental and medical providers require similar patient demographic and clinical
      information for the management of a mutual patient. Despite an overlap in
      information needs, medical and dental data are created and stored in multiple
      records and locations. Electronic health information exchange (HIE) bridge gaps
      in health data spread across various providers. Enabling exchange via query-based
      HIE may provide critical information at the point of care during a dental visit. 
      The purpose of this study is to characterize query-based HIE use during dental
      visits at two Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) that provided on-site
      dental services. First, we determine the proportion of dental visits for which
      providers accessed the HIE. Next, site, patient and visit characteristics
      associated with query-based HIE use during dental visits are examined. Last,
      among dental visits with HIE use, the aspects of the HIE that are accessed most
      frequently are described. HIE use was low (0.17%) during dental visits, however
      our findings from this study extend the body of research examining HIE use by
      studying a less explored area of the care continuum.

TI  - Pregnancy and health in the age of the Internet: A content analysis of online
      "birth club" forums.
PG  - e0230947
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0230947 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although studies report that more than 90% of pregnant women utilize 
      digital sources to supplement their maternal healthcare, little is known about
      the kinds of information that women seek from their peers during pregnancy. To
      date, most research has used self-report measures to elucidate how and why women 
      to turn to digital sources during pregnancy. However, given that these measures
      may differ from actual utilization of online health information, it is important 
      to analyze the online content pregnant women generate. OBJECTIVE: To apply
      machine learning methods to analyze online pregnancy forums, to better understand
      how women seek information from a community of online peers during pregnancy.
      METHODS: Data from seven WhatToExpect.com "birth club" forums (September 2018;
      January-June 2018) were scraped. Forum posts were collected for a one-year
      period, which included three trimesters and three months postpartum. Only initial
      posts from each thread were analyzed (n = 262,238). Automatic natural language
      processing (NLP) methods captured 50 discussed topics, which were annotated by
      two independent coders and grouped categorically. RESULTS: The largest topic
      categories were maternal health (45%), baby-related topics (29%), and
      people/relationships (10%). While pain was a popular topic all throughout
      pregnancy, individual topics that were dominant by trimester included miscarriage
      (first trimester), labor (third trimester), and baby sleeping routine (postpartum
      period). CONCLUSION: More than just emotional or peer support, pregnant women
      turn to online forums to discuss their health. Dominant topics, such as labor and
      miscarriage, suggest unmet informational needs in these domains. With
      misinformation becoming a growing public health concern, more attention must be
      directed toward peer-exchange outlets.

TI  - The (Re)-Relaunching of the DMP, the French Shared Medical Record: New Features
      to Improve Uptake and Use.
PG  - 256-260
AB  - Health care delivery for patients with chronic conditions is complex and
      confusing. Care is often fragmented, less effective, and sometimes harmful. Given
      the potential for EHRs and other health IT systems to facilitate information flow
      between providers, patients, and settings, health IT-based measures are of
      particular interest for care coordination. Health information exchange (HIE) has 
      the potential to improve the quality of healthcare by enabling providers with
      better access to patient information from multiple sources at the point of care. 
      However, many barriers to HIE use have been reported. Another solution relies on 
      the implementation of a nationwide centralized framework of clinical information 
      sharing with "new" secure online care records stored in specifically created
      platforms. The French DMP follows this model but the adoption of the tool has
      been historically poor. In 2016, a renovation of the DMP program was launched in 
      nine pilot French departments and new features have been implemented: the DMP
      content has been fully specified, patients can create their DMP by themselves,
      DMPs are automatically filled in by data claims, a mobile app has been developed,
      and technical issues about DMP and EHRs interoperability have been resolved. In
      October 2017, over 900,000 people have a DMP with an average new DMP being
      created every minute. These results have to be confirmed in 2018 when the new DMP
      will be deployed on the whole French territory.

TI  - Understanding the Use of Smartphone Apps for Health Information Among Pregnant
      Chinese Women: Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e12631
LID - 10.2196/12631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-based health promotion resources to assist pregnant women in
      adopting a healthy lifestyle and optimizing gestational weight gain are
      important, but with limited effects. Increasingly, women are using mobile apps to
      access health information during the antenatal period. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the
      study were to investigate app-usage by Chinese women during pregnancy and to gain
      a better understanding of their views and attitudes toward apps containing health
      information. METHODS: A mixed methods study design was applied. Study
      participants were recruited from 2 maternity hospitals in Shanghai, China,
      between March and July 2018. A self-administered Web-based survey was conducted
      with 535 pregnant Chinese women on their sources of health information and
      reasons for using apps during pregnancy. A total of 4 semistructured focus groups
      were also conducted with the pregnant women (n=28). RESULTS: The use of
      pregnancy-related apps and the internet was common among the respondents. Almost 
      half of the women had used pregnancy-related apps. Specifically, the use of apps 
      for health information declined as pregnancy progressed from 70% (35/50) in the
      first trimester to 41.3% (143/346) in the third trimester. The main reason for
      using an app was to monitor fetal development (436/535, 81.5%), followed by
      learning about nutrition and recording diet in pregnancy (140/535, 26.2%). The
      women found that the apps were useful and convenient and can support lifestyle
      modifications during pregnancy. However, some apps also contained misinformation 
      or incorrect information that could cause anxiety as reported by the
      participants. Many women expressed the need for developing an app containing
      evidence-based, well-informed, and tailored health information to support them
      during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that apps were widely used by
      many Chinese women during pregnancy to monitor fetal development, to obtain diet 
      and physical activity information, and to track their body changes. The women
      highly appreciated the evidence-based information, expert opinions, and tailored 
      advice available on apps. Smartphone apps have the potential to deliver health
      information for pregnant women.

TI  - African-led health research and capacity building- is it working?
PG  - 1104
LID - 10.1186/s12889-020-08875-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Africa bears a disproportionately high burden of globally significant
      disease but has lagged in knowledge production to address its health challenges. 
      In this contribution, we discuss the challenges and approaches to health research
      capacity strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa and propose that the recent shift to
      an African-led approach is the most optimal. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We introduce
      several capacity building approaches and recent achievements, explore why
      African-led research on the continent is a potentially paradigm-shifting and
      innovative approach, and discuss the advantages and challenges thereof. We
      reflect on the approaches used by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS)-funded
      Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence (SANTHE) consortium as
      an example of an effective African-led science and capacity building programme.
      We recommend the following as crucial components of future efforts: 1. Directly
      empowering African-based researchers, 2. Offering quality training and career
      development opportunities to large numbers of junior African scientists and
      support staff, and 3. Effective information exchange and collaboration.
      Furthermore, we argue that long-term investment from international donors and
      increasing funding commitments from African governments and philanthropies will
      be needed to realise a critical mass of local capacity and to create and sustain 
      world-class research hubs that will be conducive to address Africa's intractable 
      health challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiences so far suggest that African-led
      research has the potential to overcome the vicious cycle of brain-drain and may
      ultimately lead to improvement of health and science-led economic transformation 
      of Africa into a prosperous continent.

AB  - Genetic variants causing underlying pharmacogenetic and disease phenotypes have
      been used as the basis for clinical decision-making. However, due to the lack of 
      standards for next-generation sequencing (NGS) pipelines, reproducing genetic
      variants among institutions is still difficult. The aim of this study is to show 
      how many important variants for clinical decisions can be individually detected
      using different pipelines. Genetic variants were derived from 105 breast cancer
      patient target DNA sequences via three different variant-calling pipelines.
      HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2 tumor-only mode in the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK),
      and VarScan were used in variant calling from the sequence read data processed by
      the same NGS preprocessing tools using Variant Effect Predictor. GATK
      HaplotypeCaller, VarScan, and MuTect2 found 25,130, 16,972, and 4232 variants,
      comprising 1491, 1400, and 321 annotated variants with ClinVar significance,
      respectively. The average number of ClinVar significant variants in the patients 
      was 769.43, 16.50% of the variants were detected by only one variant caller.
      Despite variants with significant impact on clinical decision-making, the
      detected variants are different for each algorithm. To utilize genetic variants
      in the clinical field, a strict standard for NGS pipelines is essential.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interoperable health information technologies, like electronic
      health records (EHR) and health information exchange (HIE), provide greater
      access to patient information from across multiple organizations. Also, an
      increasing number of public data sources exist to describe social determinant of 
      health factors. These data may help better inform risk prediction models, but the
      relative importance or value of these data has not been established. This study
      assessed the performance of different classes of information individually, and in
      combination, in predicting emergency department (ED) revisits. METHODS: In a
      sample of 279,611 adult ED encounters. We compared the performance of Two-Class
      Boosted Decision Trees machine learning algorithm using 5 classes of information:
      1) social determinants of health measures only, 2) current visit EHR information 
      only, 3) current and historical EHR information, 4) HIE information only, and 5) 
      all available information combined. RESULTS: The social determinants of health
      measure only model had the overall worst performance with an area under the curve
      AUC of 0.61. The model using all information classes together had the best
      performance (AUC=0.732). The model using HIE information only performed better
      than all other single information class models. CONCLUSIONS: Broad information
      sources, which are reflective of patients' reliance on multiple organizations for
      care, better support risk prediction modeling in the emergency department.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate and robust quality measurement is critical to the future of
      value-based care. Having incomplete information when calculating quality measures
      can cause inaccuracies in reported patient outcomes. This research examines how
      quality calculations vary when using data from an individual electronic health
      record (EHR) and longitudinal data from a health information exchange (HIE)
      operating as a multisource registry for quality measurement. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Data were sampled from 53 healthcare organizations in 2018.
      Organizations represented both ambulatory care practices and health systems
      participating in the state of Kansas HIE. Fourteen ambulatory quality measures
      for 5300 patients were calculated using the data from an individual EHR source
      and contrasted to calculations when HIE data were added to locally recorded data.
      RESULTS: A total of 79% of patients received care at more than 1 facility during 
      the 2018 calendar year. A total of 12 994 applicable quality measure calculations
      were compared using data from the originating organization vs longitudinal data
      from the HIE. A total of 15% of all quality measure calculations changed (P <
      .001) when including HIE data sources, affecting 19% of patients. Changes in
      quality measure calculations were observed across measures and organizations.
      DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that quality measures calculated using
      single-site EHR data may be limited by incomplete information. Effective data
      sharing significantly changes quality calculations, which affect healthcare
      payments, patient safety, and care quality. CONCLUSIONS: Federal, state, and
      commercial programs that use quality measurement as part of reimbursement could
      promote more accurate and representative quality measurement through methods that
      increase clinical data sharing.

TI  - Veterans Health Information Exchange: Successes and Challenges of Nationwide
      Interoperability.
PG  - 385-394
AB  - Health Information Exchange (HIE) between organizations is necessary to have more
      complete information and coordinate care. Given its nationwide footprint, the
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) connects and exchanges health information
      with a large number of organizations and consequently has a unique opportunity to
      experience most issues affecting clinical interoperability. The Veterans HIE
      Program manages these exchanges by focusing on patient engagement, provider
      adoption, partner relationship, technology platform, and performance. This paper 
      analyzes the success and challenges of this program over the last five years, and
      offers valuable metrics and insights. Although significant progress has been
      made, nationwide interoperability remains fragmented and laborious, requiring
      multiple agreements and exchange methods. A future nationwide interoperability
      would embrace a single "on-ramp" to connect to everyone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of electronic health (eHealth) information and
      disease-related community forums has grown over the last decade. Although
      patients and families frequently use these resources, their content has not been 
      characterized in terms users, content, or reliability of information. eHealth
      communities therefore represent a potentially valuable but uncharted source of
      information about key patient issues, communication terminology, and unmet needs.
      We hypothesized that eHealth forums would contain terminology, themes, and advice
      inconsistent with resources from medical providers and references. To test this
      hypothesis, we performed a qualitative analysis of posts and responses from an
      open-access peripheral artery disease (PAD) eHealth community forum to
      characterize the discussion, participants, and the information being exchanged.
      METHODS: Posts were collected from an online PAD Medical Support Community forum 
      (MedHelp), which is open access, does not require participants to identify
      themselves, and is based in the United States. Posts were selected from threads
      in which the main topic was PAD, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment.
      Original posts and related responses were analyzed for thematic content, common
      vernacular, and self-reported characteristics of the participants using a
      qualitative analysis software program. Disease-specific comments and advice were 
      evaluated for congruence with contemporary PAD treatment guidelines. RESULTS: A
      total of 103 posts were collected and analyzed, including 40 original posts and
      63 responses. Forty-five percent of the original posts and 19% of the responses
      were authored by participants who self-identified as patients with PAD. The
      remaining posts were authored by people with undeclared relationships to patients
      with PAD, followed by children, spouses, and other relatives. The most common
      themes among original posts included PAD diagnosis (and differential) (25%),
      treatment (23%), epidemiology and pathophysiology (21%), disease symptoms and
      impacts on activities of daily living (15%), and health-care provider
      recommendations (13%). Themes of responses included medical advice (40.5%),
      personal experiences with PAD (32.8%), and social support (12.6%). Negative
      attitudes were identified in 10 of 18 (55.6%) posts related to experiences with
      health-care providers. Of all medical advice, 15.1% was inconsistent with
      clinical treatment guidelines. CONCLUSION: eHealth communities are a rich source 
      of information related to the experiences of patients with PAD, their treatment
      preferences, questions they consider important, and terminology that they use.
      This information can be used to understand unmet patient needs, develop
      educational resources, and improve communication.

TI  - Health information exchange in Finland: Usage of different access types and
      predictors of paper use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Timely, complete and accurate patient data is needed in care
      decisions along the continuum of care. To access patient data from other
      organizations, there are three types of regional health information exchange
      systems (RHIS) in use In Finland. Some regions use multiple RHISs while others do
      not have a RHIS available. The recently introduced National Patient Data
      Repository (Kanta) is increasingly used for health information exchange (HIE).
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess usage of paper, RHISs and
      Kanta by context in 2017; evolution of paper use over the years; and predictors
      of paper use in 2017 among Finnish physicians for HIE system development.
      METHODS: Data from national electronic health record (EHR) usage and user
      experience surveys were taken from 2010 (prior to ePrescription system
      implementation), 2014 (prior to implementation of Kanta) and 2017 (Kanta was in
      full use in the public sector and in large private organizations). The web-based 
      surveys were targeted to all physicians engaged in clinical work in Finland.
      RESULTS: Kanta was the most frequently used means of HIE in 2017. Paper use had
      reduced significantly from 2010 to 2014. The trend continued in 2017. Still, up
      to half of the physicians reported using paper daily or weekly in 2017. There
      were great variations in paper use by healthcare sector, available RHIS type and 
      EHR system used. In multivariable analysis (with all other variables constant),
      predictors of more frequent use of paper than electronic means for HIE were:
      private sector or hospital, access to Master Patient Index RHIS (type 1),
      multiple RHIS (type 4) or no RHIS (type 5), two particular EHR systems, older
      age, less experience, operative, psychiatric or diagnostic specialties, and male 
      gender. CONCLUSIONS: Usability of HIE systems including EHRs as access points to 
      HIE need to be improved to facilitate usage of electronic HIE. Usage ensures more
      timely and complete patient data for safe, coordinated care. Specialty-specific
      needs and requirements call for more user participation in HIE design. Especially
      older professionals need training to better exploit HIS for HIE.

TI  - Mind the gap: the potential of alternative health information exchange.
PG  - 32-38
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of patient transitions that could be
      connected through 3 proprietary alternatives to open, community-based health
      information exchange (HIE): HIE between physicians who are part of the same
      integrated system, use the same electronic health record (EHR), or use an EHR
      that participates in an EHR vendor alliance. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      analysis of Medicare patient transitions and physician EHR adoption and
      organizational affiliation from SK&A. METHODS: We characterized the percentage of
      transitions that could be covered by each HIE approach and the degree of
      redundancy. We then assessed whether coverage opportunities differed by provider 
      type and used multivariate linear regression to estimate the association between 
      physician characteristics and proportion of transitions uncovered by any
      proprietary approach (ie, requiring an open HIE approach). RESULTS: Given current
      EHR adoption and organizational affiliations, 33% of transitions could be covered
      by proprietary HIE. For the average physician, open methods of HIE would still be
      needed for 45% of patients treated by other physicians. Physicians who did not
      use a market-leading EHR, were not members of a large integrated system, and
      shared patients with a broader network of physicians have the greatest need for
      open HIE. CONCLUSIONS: Proprietary approaches to HIE do not eliminate the need
      for open HIE and may further disadvantage providers in small healthcare
      organizations using less common EHRs. Ongoing support and innovative value
      creation within open HIE will likely remain necessary to support HIE by
      independent physicians. Public efforts to promote interoperability should seek to
      integrate proprietary models with open HIE.

LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1121-4 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and complete medical data are one valuable asset for patients. Privacy
      protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during
      medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records 
      has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain
      technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the
      characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain
      technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we
      design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and
      cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is
      described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are
      presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The
      proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no
      single party has absolute power to affect the processing.

LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2870319 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health systems, such as telecare medical information system (TMIS),
      allow patients to exchange their health information with a medical center/doctor 
      for diagnosis in real time, and across borders. Given the sensitive nature of
      health information/medical data, ensuring the security of such systems is
      crucial. In this paper, we revisit Das et al.'s authentication protocol, which is
      designed to ensure patient anonymity and untraceability. Then, we demonstrate
      that the security claims are invalid, by showing how both security features
      (i.e., patient anonymity and untraceability) can be compromised. We also
      demonstrate that the protocol suffers from smartcard launch attacks. To mitigate 
      such design flaws, we propose a new lightweight authentication protocol using the
      cryptographic hash function for TMIS. We then analyze the security of the
      proposed protocol using AVISPA and Scyther, two widely used formal specification 
      tools. The performance analysis demonstrates that our protocol is more efficient 
      than other competing protocols.

      - New York City, 2013-2015.
PG  - e0237392
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0237392 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Birth defects surveillance in the United States is conducted
      principally by review of routine but lagged reporting to statewide congenital
      malformations registries of diagnoses by hospitals or other health care
      providers, a process that is not designed to rapidly detect changes in
      prevalence. Health information exchange (HIE) systems are well suited for rapid
      surveillance, but information is limited about their effectiveness at detecting
      birth defects. We evaluated HIE data to detect microcephaly diagnosed at birth
      during January 1, 2013-December 31, 2015 before known introduction of Zika virus 
      in North America. METHODS: Data from an HIE system were queried for microcephaly 
      diagnostic codes on day of birth or during the first two days after birth at
      three Bronx hospitals for births to New York City resident mothers. Suspected
      cases identified by HIE data were compared with microcephaly cases that had been 
      identified through direct inquiry of hospital records and confirmed by chart
      abstraction in a previous study of the same cohort. RESULTS: Of 16,910 live
      births, 43 suspected microcephaly cases were identified through an HIE system
      compared to 67 confirmed cases that had been identified as part of the prior
      study. A total of 39 confirmed cases were found by both studies (sensitivity =
      58.21%, 95% CI: 45.52-70.15%; positive predictive value = 90.70%, 95% CI:
      77.86-97.41%; negative predictive value = 99.83%, 95% CI: 99.76-99.89% for HIE
      data). CONCLUSION: Despite limitations, HIE systems could be used for rapid
      newborn microcephaly surveillance, especially in the many jurisdictions where
      more labor-intensive approaches are not feasible. Future work is needed to
      improve electronic medical record documentation quality to improve sensitivity
      and reduce misclassification.

      for clinical trials. Patient attrition and recall bias affects the validity of
      patient-reported outcomes, and the growing prevalence of Medicare Advantage (MA) 
      could mean Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims are less reliable for ascertaining
      hospital utilization. Statewide health information exchanges (HIEs) may be a more
      complete data source but have not been frequently used for research. DESIGN:
      Secondary analysis comparing identification of readmissions using 3 different
      acquisition approaches. SETTING: Randomized controlled trial of heart failure
      (HF) disease management in 37 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). PARTICIPANTS:
      Patients with HF discharged from the hospital to SNF. MEASURES: Readmissions up
      to 60 days post-SNF admission collected by patient self-report, recorded by
      nursing home (NH) staff during the SNF stay, or recorded in the state HIE.
      RESULTS: Among 657 participants (mean age 79 +/- 10 years, 49% with FFS), 295
      unique readmissions within 60 days of SNF admission were identified. These
      readmissions occurred among 221 patients. Twenty percent of all readmissions were
      found using only patient self-report, 28% were only recorded by NH staff during
      the SNF stay, and 52% were identified only using the HIE. The readmission rate
      (first readmission only) based only on patient self-report and direct observation
      was 18% rather than 34% with the addition of the enhanced HIE method. CONCLUSIONS
      AND IMPLICATIONS: More than one-quarter (34%) of HF patients were rehospitalized 
      within 60 days post SNF admission. Use of a statewide HIE resulted in identifying
      an additional 153 admissions, 52% of all the readmissions seen in this study.
      Without use of an HIE, nearly half of readmissions would have been missed as a
      result of incomplete patient self-report or loss to follow-up. Thus, HIEs serve
      as an important resource for researchers to ensure accurate outcomes data.

TI  - User Centered Design to Improve Information Exchange in Diabetes Care Through
      eHealth : Results from a Small Scale Exploratory Study.

AB  - Heterogeneity of people with diabetes makes maintaining blood glucose control and
      achieving therapy adherence a challenge. It is fundamental that patients get
      actively involved in the management of the disease in their living environments. 
      The objective of this paper is to evaluate the use and acceptance of a
      self-management system for diabetes developed with User Centered Design
      Principles in community settings. Persons with diabetes and health professionals 
      were involved the design, development and evaluation of the self-management
      system; which comprised three iterative cycles: scenario definition, user
      archetype definition and system development. A comprehensive system was developed
      integrating modules for the management of blood glucose levels, medication, food 
      intake habits, physical activity, diabetes education and messaging. The system
      was adapted for two types of principal users (personas): Type 1 Diabetes user and
      Type 2 Diabetes user. The system was evaluated by assessing the use, the
      compliance, the attractiveness and perceived usefulness in a multicenter
      randomized pilot study involving 20 patients and 24 treating professionals for a 
      period of four weeks. Usage and compliance of the co-designed system was compared
      during the first and the last two weeks of the study, showing a significantly
      improved behaviour of patients towards the system for each of the modules. This
      resulted in a successful adoption by both type of personas. Only the medication
      module showed a significantly different use and compliance (p= 0.01) which can be
      explained by the different therapeutic course of the two types of diabetes. The
      involvement of patients to make their own decisions and choices form design
      stages was key for the adoption of a self-management system for diabetes.

TI  - Ebola-Related Health Information Wanted and Obtained by Nurses and Public Health 
      Department Employees: Effects of Formal and Informal Communication Channels.
PG  - 312-321
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2019.45 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to (1) understand types and amounts of
      Ebola-related information that health organization employees wanted and obtained 
      through formal, informal, internal, and external organizational communication
      channels; (2) determine potential discrepancies between information wanted and
      obtained; and (3) investigate how organizational structure might affect
      information wanted and obtained through these communication channels. METHODS:
      Primary data were collected from 526 health workers in 9 hospitals and 13 public 
      health departments in Texas from June to November 2015. Survey data were
      collected for 7 types of Ebola-related information health organization employees 
      wanted and obtained through various types of organizational communication
      channels. Descriptive statistical analyses, mixed design analysis of variance,
      regression analyses, and multilevel analyses were used to analyze the data.
      RESULTS: Hospital employees (mostly nurses in our sample) received more self-care
      information than they wanted from every communication channel. However, they
      received less about all other types of information than they wanted from every
      communication channel separately and combined. Public health department employees
      wanted more information than they received from every communication channel
      separately and combined for all 7 types of information. CONCLUSIONS:
      Discrepancies existed between the types of Ebola-related information wanted and
      obtained by employees of hospitals and public health departments.

TI  - Information exchange using a prescribed form and involvement of occupational
      health nurses promotes occupational physicians to collaborate with attending
      physicians for supporting workers with illness in Japan.
PG  - 10-21
LID - 10.2486/indhealth.2017-0133 [doi]
AB  - The maintenance of a balance between work and disease treatment is an important
      issue in Japan. This study explored factors that affect collaboration between
      occupational physicians (OPs) and attending physicians (APs). A questionnaire was
      mailed to 1,102 OPs. The questionnaire assessed the demographic characteristics
      of OPs; their opinions and behaviors related to collaboration, including the
      exchange of medical information with APs; and the occupational health service
      system at their establishments. In total, 275 OPs completed the questionnaire
      (25.0% response rate). Over 80% of respondents believed OPs should collaborate
      with APs. After adjusting for company size, collaboration >/=10 times/yr (with
      regard to both returning to work following sick leave and annual health check-ups
      for employees) was significantly associated with environmental factors, such as
      the presence of occupational health nurses (odds ratio (OR): 5.56 and 5.01,
      respectively, p<0.05) and the use of prescribed forms for information exchange
      (OR: 4.21 and 3.63, respectively, p<0.05) but not with the demographic
      characteristics of the OPs (p>0.05). The majority of OPs believed that
      collaboration with APs is important for supporting workers with illnesses.
      Support systems including prescribed forms of information exchange and
      occupational health nurses, play pivotal roles in promoting this collaboration.

TI  - Public Disclosure on Social Media of Identifiable Patient Information by Health
      Professionals: Content Analysis of Twitter Data.
PG  - e19746
LID - 10.2196/19746 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respecting patient privacy and confidentiality is critical for
      doctor-patient relationships and public trust in medical professionals. The
      frequency of potentially identifiable disclosures online during periods of active
      engagement is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify
      potentially identifiable content shared on social media by physicians and other
      health care providers using the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. METHODS: We
      accessed and searched Twitter's API using Symplur software for tweets that
      included the hashtag #ShareAStoryInOneTweet. We identified 1206 tweets by
      doctors, nurses, and other health professionals out of 43,374 tweets shared in
      May 2018. Tweet content was evaluated in January 2019 to determine the incidence 
      of instances where names or potentially identifiable information about patients
      were shared; content analysis of tweets in which information about others had
      been disclosed was performed. The study also evaluated whether participants
      raised concerns about privacy breaches and estimated the frequency of deleted
      tweets. The study used dual, blinded coding for a 10% sample to estimate
      intercoder reliability using Cohen kappa statistic for identifying the potential 
      identifiability of tweet content. RESULTS: Health care professionals (n=656)
      disclosing information about others included 486 doctors (74.1%) and 98 nurses
      (14.9%). Health care professionals sharing stories about patient care disclosed
      the time frame in 95 tweets (95/754, 12.6%) and included patient names in 15
      tweets (15/754, 2.0%). It is estimated that friends or families could likely
      identify the clinical scenario described in 242 of the 754 tweets (32.1%). Among 
      348 tweets about potentially living patients, it was estimated that 162 (46.6%)
      were likely identifiable by patients. Intercoder reliability in rating the
      potential identifiability demonstrated 86.8% agreement, with a Cohen kappa of 0.8
      suggesting substantial agreement. We also identified 78 out of 754 tweets (6.5%) 
      that had been deleted on the website but were still viewable in the analytics
      software data set. CONCLUSIONS: During periods of active sharing online, nurses, 
      physicians, and other health professionals may sometimes share more information
      than patients or families might expect. More study is needed to determine whether
      similar events arise frequently and to understand how to best ensure that
      patients' rights are adequately respected.

      of public- and private-sector initiatives aimed at halting or even reversing this
      trend. Recognizing common interests in this issue, the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention, NIH, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation began
      conversations about creating a formal collaboration aimed at accelerating efforts
      to address childhood obesity by coordinating research agendas and providing
      support for evidence-building activities. The National Collaborative on Childhood
      Obesity Research (NCCOR) was launched in February 2009, and the U.S. Department
      of Agriculture joined in 2010. Using the model provided by other previously
      successful collaborations, such as the Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative,
      NCCOR has emphasized several principles suggested by Petrovich as key elements
      for successful partnerships: (1) delineate a common purpose by identifying key
      knowledge gaps in the field; (2) create a shared identity around that common
      purpose; (3) develop structures for democratic and respectful collaboration so as
      to strategically coordinate efforts for maximum national impact; (4) identify
      effective leaders capable of articulating challenges in the field and inspiring a
      commitment of minds and the resolve to address identified needs; (5) facilitate
      continuous knowledge exchange and synthesis to keep the field informed; and (6)
      support assessment of progress and feedback loops for ensuring continual
      progress. This paper examines how NCCOR has used these principles to help build
      the field of research, evaluation, and surveillance for childhood obesity
      prevention and management.

TI  - Mapping of HIE CT terms to LOINC(R): analysis of content-dependent coverage and
      coverage improvement through new term creation.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy135 [doi]
AB  - Objective: We describe and evaluate the mapping of computerized tomography (CT)
      terms from 40 hospitals participating in a health information exchange (HIE) to a
      standard terminology. Methods: Proprietary CT exam terms and corresponding exam
      frequency data were obtained from 40 participant HIE sites that transmitted
      radiology data to the HIE from January 2013 through October 2015. These terms
      were mapped to the Logical Observations Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC(R))
      terminology using the Regenstrief LOINC mapping assistant (RELMA) beginning in
      January 2016. Terms without initial LOINC match were submitted to LOINC as new
      term requests on an ongoing basis. After new LOINC terms were created,
      proprietary terms without an initial match were reviewed and mapped to these new 
      LOINC terms where appropriate. Content type and token coverage were calculated
      for the LOINC version at the time of initial mapping (v2.54) and for the most
      recently released version at the time of our analysis (v2.63). Descriptive
      analysis was performed to assess for significant differences in content-dependent
      coverage between the 2 versions. Results: LOINC's content type and token
      coverages of HIE CT exam terms for version 2.54 were 83% and 95%, respectively.
      Two-hundred-fifteen new LOINC CT terms were created in the interval between the
      releases of version 2.54 and 2.63, and content type and token coverages,
      respectively, increased to 93% and 99% (P < .001). Conclusion: LOINC's content
      type coverage of proprietary CT terms across 40 HIE sites was 83% but improved
      significantly to 93% following new term creation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This commentary summarizes the methods and topics addressed in the
      special issue of HSR focused on linkage of United States Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) and non-VA datasets. The issue illustrates that researchers are
      increasingly linking diverse datasets as a valuable method for obtaining
      outcomes, treatments, and covariates to evaluate and examine health care delivery
      that includes non-VA services. The issue serves as a reference to VA and non-VA
      investigators alike who employ data linkage methods to address high-impact
      clinical and health policy evaluations that span different care systems and
      different datasets.

TI  - Assessment of Traceability Implementation of a Cross-Institutional Secure Data
      Collection System Based on Distributed Standardized EMR Storage.
PG  - 1373-1377
LID - 10.3233/SHTI190452 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents results concerning the traceability of a secure data
      collection infrastructure based on the Bloom Filter involving standardized
      electronic medical record (EMR) storage. The objective of this infrastructure is 
      to facilitate rapid secondary use of exported EMR data in cross-patient or
      cross-institutional analyses based on the Standardized Structured Medical
      Information eXchange (SS-MIX), Japan's domestic standard for EMR export.
      Secondary use of EMR data should be based on the principle of patient consent.
      Therefore, securing the traceability of patient EMR data is important for
      achieving reliable data collection systems for secondary use. Blockchain is a
      strong candidate, and we evaluated its performance using several implementations.
      As shown by the evaluation, it is difficult to realize the method of recording
      the query history of secondary use on the blockchain. We thus propose a method
      for recording index information of distributed log data.

TI  - A strategic gaming model for health information exchange markets.
PG  - 119-130
LID - 10.1007/s10729-016-9382-2 [doi]
AB  - Current market conditions create incentives for some providers to exercise
      control over patient data in ways that unreasonably limit its availability and
      use. Here we develop a game theoretic model for estimating the willingness of
      healthcare organizations to join a health information exchange (HIE) network and 
      demonstrate its use in HIE policy design. We formulated the model as a bi-level
      integer program. A quasi-Newton method is proposed to obtain a strategy Nash
      equilibrium. We applied our modeling and solution technique to 1,093,177
      encounters for exchanging information over a 7.5-year period in 9 hospitals
      located within a three-county region in Florida. Under a set of assumptions, we
      found that a proposed federal penalty of up to $2,000,000 has a higher impact on 
      increasing HIE adoption than current federal monetary incentives. Medium-sized
      hospitals were more reticent to adopt HIE than large-sized hospitals. In the
      presence of collusion among multiple hospitals to not adopt HIE, neither federal 
      incentives nor proposed penalties increase hospitals' willingness to adopt.
      Hospitals' apathy toward HIE adoption may threaten the value of
      inter-connectivity even with federal incentives in place. Competition among
      hospitals, coupled with volume-based payment systems, creates no incentives for
      smaller hospitals to exchange data with competitors. Medium-sized hospitals need 
      targeted actions (e.g., outside technological assistance, group purchasing
      arrangements) to mitigate market incentives to not adopt HIE. Strategic game
      theoretic models help to clarify HIE adoption decisions under market conditions
      at play in an extremely complex technology environment.

TI  - Coordination of Care as Experienced by the Specialist: Validation of the
      CSC-Specialist Survey in the Private Sector and the Effect of a Shared Electronic
      Health Record.
PG  - 1051-1058
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0000000000001402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously developed 2 complementary surveys to measure
      coordination of care as experienced by the specialist and the primary care
      provider (PCP). These Coordination of Specialty Care (CSC) surveys were developed
      in the Veterans Health Administration (VA), under an integrated organizational
      umbrella that includes a shared electronic health record (EHR). OBJECTIVE: To
      develop an augmented version of the CSC-Specialist in the private sector and use 
      that version (CSC-Specialist 2.0) to examine the effect of a shared EHR on
      coordination. RESEARCH DESIGN: We administered the survey online to a national
      sample of clinicians from 10 internal medicine subspecialties. We used multitrait
      analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties
      of the original VA-based survey and develop an augmented private sector survey
      (CSC-Specialist 2.0). We tested construct validity by regressing a single-item
      measure of overall coordination onto the 4 scales. We used analysis of variance
      to examine the relationship of a shared EHR to coordination. RESULTS:
      Psychometric assessment supported the 13-item, 4-scale structure of the original 
      VA measure and the augmented 18-item, 4-scale structure of the CSC-Specialist
      2.0. The CSC-Specialist 2.0 scales together explained 45% of the variance in
      overall coordination. A shared EHR was associated with significantly better
      scores for the Roles and Responsibilities and Data Transfer scales, and for
      overall coordination. CONCLUSIONS: The CSC-Specialist 2.0 is a unique survey that
      demonstrates adequate psychometric performance and is sensitive to use of a
      shared EHR. It can be used alone or with the CSC-PCP to identify coordination
      problems, guide interventions, and measure improvements.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sharing patient data across institutions to train generalizable deep 
      learning models is challenging due to regulatory and technical hurdles.
      Distributed learning, where model weights are shared instead of patient data,
      presents an attractive alternative. Cyclical weight transfer (CWT) has recently
      been demonstrated as an effective distributed learning method for medical imaging
      with homogeneous data across institutions. In this study, we optimize CWT to
      overcome performance losses from variability in training sample sizes and label
      distributions across institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimizations included 
      proportional local training iterations, cyclical learning rate, locally weighted 
      minibatch sampling, and cyclically weighted loss. We evaluated our optimizations 
      on simulated distributed diabetic retinopathy detection and chest radiograph
      classification. RESULTS: Proportional local training iteration mitigated
      performance losses from sample size variability, achieving 98.6% of the accuracy 
      attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split with
      highest sample size variance across institutions. Locally weighted minibatch
      sampling and cyclically weighted loss both mitigated performance losses from
      label distribution variability, achieving 98.6% and 99.1%, respectively, of the
      accuracy attained by centrally hosting in the diabetic retinopathy dataset split 
      with highest label distribution variability across institutions. DISCUSSION: Our 
      optimizations to CWT improve its capability of handling data variability across
      institutions. Compared to CWT without optimizations, CWT with optimizations
      achieved performance significantly closer to performance from centrally hosting. 
      CONCLUSION: Our work is the first to identify and address challenges of sample
      size and label distribution variability in simulated distributed deep learning
      for medical imaging. Future work is needed to address other sources of real-world
      data variability.

TI  - Opt-in consent policies: potential barriers to hospital health information
      exchange.
PG  - e14-e20
LID - 10.37765/ajmc.2020.42148 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To (1) assess whether hospitals in states requiring explicit patient 
      consent ("opt-in") for health information exchange (HIE) are more likely to
      report regulatory barriers to HIE and (2) analyze whether these policies
      correlate with hospital volume of HIE. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 
      US nonfederal acute care hospitals in 2016. METHODS: We combined legal
      scholarship surveying HIE-relevant state laws with the American Hospital
      Association Annual Information Technology Supplement for regulatory barriers and 
      hospital characteristics. Data from CMS reports for hospitals attesting to
      Meaningful Use stage 2 (MU2; renamed "Promoting Interoperability" in 2018) in
      2016 captured hospital HIE volume. We used multivariate logistic regression and
      linear regression to estimate the association of opt-in state consent policies
      with reported regulatory barriers and HIE volume, respectively. RESULTS:
      Hospitals in states with opt-in consent policies were 7.8 percentage points more 
      likely than hospitals in opt-out states to report regulatory barriers to HIE (P =
      .03). In subgroup analyses, this finding held among hospitals that did not attest
      to MU2 (7.7 percentage points; P = .02). Among hospitals attesting, we did not
      find a relationship between opt-in policies and regulatory barriers (8.0
      percentage points; P = .13) or evidence of a relationship between opt-in policies
      and HIE volume (beta = 0.56; P = .76). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that
      opt-in consent laws may carry greater administrative burdens compared with
      opt-out policies. However, less technologically advanced hospitals may bear more 
      of this burden. Furthermore, opt-in policies may not affect HIE volume for
      hospitals that have already achieved a degree of technological sophistication.
      Policy makers should carefully consider the incidence of administrative burdens
      when crafting laws pertaining to HIE.

TI  - The efficacy of public health information for encouraging radon gas awareness and
      testing varies by audience age, sex and profession.
PG  - 11906
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-91479-7 [doi]
AB  - Radioactive radon inhalation is a leading cause of lung cancer and underlies an
      ongoing public health crisis. Radon exposure prevention strategies typically
      begin by informing populations about health effects, and their initial efficacy
      is measured by how well and how fast information convinces individuals to test
      properties. This communication process is rarely individualized, and there is
      little understanding if messages impact diverse demographics equally. Here, we
      explored how 2,390 people interested in radon testing differed in their reaction 
      to radon's public health information and their subsequent decision to test. Only 
      20% were prompted to radon test after 1 encounter with awareness information,
      while 65% required 2-5 encounters over several months, and 15% needed 6 to > 10
      encounters over many years. People who most delayed testing were more likely to
      be men or involved in engineering, architecture, real estate and/or physical
      science-related professions. Social pressures were not a major factor influencing
      radon testing. People who were the least worried about radon health risks were
      older and/or men, while negative emotional responses to awareness information
      were reported more by younger people, women and/or parents. This highlights the
      importance of developing targeted demographic messaging to create effective radon
      exposure prevention strategies.

AB  - Successful transition of patients between health care entities is difficult.
      Historically, the process of transitioning individuals through the corrections
      system with regard to health care was made even more challenging by the
      limitation of paper records. Recently, the advent of electronic medical records
      has improved health care nationwide. The use of health information exchange (HIE)
      systems in areas such as emergency medicine has also impacted patient outcomes.
      To date, this technology has not been used in the corrections system.
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 correctional health care
      professionals, corrections staff, and public health entities to evaluate the
      novel implementation of HIE at a local correctional facility. This article
      describes the challenges and successes that occurred during the implementation
      and their implications for successful implementations in the future.

AB  - Health information exchange (HIE) is implemented in Quebec, Canada to improve the
      exchange and use of clinical information for decision making in the province's
      health care system. The objective of this mixed-method approach study was to
      evaluate the usage, usability, and usefulness of an electronic health record
      (EHR) to access and import clinical information from a centralized HIE. First, a 
      heuristic analysis was performed of three different commercial EHRs, using end
      users to analyze the integration feature through think aloud protocols. Second,
      interviews were conducted with advanced users to describe the usefulness. Third, 
      usage data were analyzed to describe the level of use of each data domain, per
      EHR and user. The results show that usefulness is high for medication data;
      leading to greater use of this domain, its relation to integration, and meets the
      needs of general practitioners. Difficulties in the implementation processes
      reduced the potential of this system.

TI  - A mixed-method service evaluation of health information exchange in England:
      technology acceptance and barriers and facilitators to adoption.
PG  - 737
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06771-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The need for information exchange and integrated care has stimulated 
      the development of interoperability solutions that bring together patient data
      across the health and care system to enable effective information sharing. Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) solutions have been shown to be effective in
      supporting patient care, however, user adoption often varies among users and care
      settings. This service evaluation aimed to measure user acceptance of HIE and
      explore barriers and facilitators to its wider uptake. METHODS: A mixed-method
      study design was used. A questionnaire was developed using the Unified Theory of 
      Acceptance and Use of Technology and administered to HIE users to assess
      technology acceptance. Pearson Chi(2) tests were used to examine differences in
      acceptance between user groups and care settings. Web-based, semi-structured
      interviews were conducted drawing on the Normalisation Process Theory to explore 
      barriers and facilitators to adoption. Interview data were analysed thematically 
      using the Framework Approach. RESULTS: A total of 105 HIE users completed the
      survey and another 12 participated in the interviews. Significant differences
      were found in HIE acceptance between users groups and care settings, with high
      adopters demonstrating higher acceptance and social care users showing lower
      acceptance. Participants identified several drivers to adoption, including
      increased information accessibility, better care coordination, informed
      decision-making, improved patient care, reduced duplication of procedures, and
      time and cost savings. However, they also highlighted a number of barriers, such 
      as lack of awareness about the solution and its value, suboptimal communication
      strategies, inadequate training and lack of resources for knowledge
      dissemination, absence of champions to support the implementation, lack of
      end-user involvement in the implementation and evaluation of HIE, unclear
      accountability and responsibility for the overall success of the programme, and
      patient confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Working to better engage
      stakeholders, considering the needs of users from different care settings,
      providing users with training resources and support to increase their knowledge
      and confidence in using the system, developing implementation strategies to seek 
      user feedback and monitor performance, and using communication strategies to
      increase awareness of the product and its value, can help improve uptake and
      adoption of HIE.

TI  - Evaluating the Quality of Health Information in a Changing Digital Ecosystem.
PG  - e11129
LID - 10.2196/11129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical evaluation of online health information has always been
      central to consumer health informatics. However, with the emergence of new Web
      media platforms and the ubiquity of social media, the issue has taken on a new
      dimension and urgency. At the same time, many established existing information
      quality evaluation guidelines address information characteristics other than the 
      content (eg, authority and currency), target information creators rather than
      users as their main audience, or do not address information presented via novel
      Web technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this formative study was to (1) develop a
      methodological approach for analyzing health-related Web pages and (2) apply it
      to a set of relevant Web pages. METHODS: This qualitative study analyzed 25 type 
      2 diabetes pages, which were derived from the results of a Google search with the
      keywords "diabetes," "reversal," and "natural." The coding scheme, developed via 
      a combination of theory- and data-driven approaches, includes 5 categories from
      existing guidelines (resource type, information authority, validity of background
      information sources, objectivity, and currency) and 7 novel categories (treatment
      or reversal method, promises and certainty, criticisms of establishment,
      emotional appeal, vocabulary, rhetoric and presentation, and use of science in
      argumentation). The coding involves both categorical judgment and in-depth
      narrative characterization. On establishing satisfactory level of agreement on
      the narrative coding, the team coded the complete dataset of 25 pages. RESULTS:
      The results set included "traditional" static pages, videos, and digitized
      versions of printed newspapers or magazine articles. Treatments proposed by the
      pages included a mixture of conventional evidence-based treatments (eg, healthy
      balanced diet exercise) and unconventional treatments (eg, dietary supplements,
      optimizing gut flora). Most pages either promised or strongly implied high
      likelihood of complete recovery. Pages varied greatly with respect to the
      authors' stated background and credentials as well as the information sources
      they referenced or mentioned. The majority included criticisms of the traditional
      health care establishment. Many sold commercial products ranging from dietary
      supplements to books. The pages frequently used colloquial language. A
      significant number included emotional personal anecdotes, made positive mentions 
      of the word cure, and included references to nature as a positive healing force. 
      Most pages presented some biological explanations of their proposed treatments.
      Some of the explanations involved the level of complexity well beyond the level
      of an educated layperson. CONCLUSIONS: Both traditional and data-driven
      categories of codes used in this work yielded insights about the resources and
      highlighted challenges faced by their users. This exploratory study underscores
      the challenges of consumer health information seeking and the importance of
      developing support tools that would help users seek, evaluate, and analyze
      information in the changing digital ecosystem.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incorporation of a state health information exchange
      (HIE) into a community pharmacy transitions of care (TOC) service and to assess
      its impact on 30-day readmission rates. SETTING: Three suburban community
      pharmacies in Olathe, Kansas. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Balls Food Stores is a
      grocery store chain which operates 21 supermarket community pharmacies in the
      Kansas City metropolitan area. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Balls Food Stores launched a 
      pharmacist-led self-referral TOC study in which a state HIE was utilized to
      collect discharge information from patients' electronic medical records (EMRs) to
      facilitate TOC comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs). EVALUATION: Descriptive
      statistics were used to assess types and outcomes of identified drug therapy
      problems and the ability to access Kansas Health Information Network EMRs. A
      chi-square test was used to assess 30-day readmissions between patients who
      accepted and declined the service. RESULTS: Forty patients were identified for
      inclusion and 18 elected to participate in the service. The majority of
      participants were white females with a median age of 64.5 years. Out of 40 study 
      patients, 85% had an EMR available; 12.5% of patients had a medication list
      included in their EMR hospitalization documentation. Participants who underwent
      the service had a statistically significantly lower rate of overall 30-day
      hospital readmission than those who declined (11.1% vs 36.4%, P = 0.032). Among
      the 18 TOC CMRs performed, 90 drug therapy problems were identified and 77 were
      resolved in collaboration with a patient, caregiver, or physician. CONCLUSION:
      Incorporation of a state HIE into a community pharmacist-led TOC service is a
      novel strategy for collecting patient data. During the study, no TOC participants
      were readmitted within 30 days. However, pharmacists found HIE data alone was
      insufficient to perform TOC CMRs for the majority of participants. In order to
      expand state HIE utilization, more health systems will need to upload a minimum
      standard data set to help facilitate care.

TI  - Impact of primary and specialty care integration via asynchronous communication.
PG  - 26-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate the impact of primary and specialty care
      integration via asynchronous communication at a large integrated healthcare
      system. STUDY DESIGN: In January 2014, Geisinger's primary care providers (PCPs) 
      were given access to an asynchronous communication tool, Ask-a-Doc (AAD), that
      enabled direct communication with specialists in 14 medical specialties and 5
      surgical specialties. Internal data were collected to assess PCPs' acceptance and
      use of the tool, as well as satisfaction. Insurance claims data were obtained to 
      assess the impact on healthcare utilization and cost. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis of health plan claims data was conducted among those patients who had at
      least 1 specialist visit with 1 of the participating specialties between January 
      2014 and December 2016. A set of difference-in-differences multivariate linear
      regression models with patient fixed effects was estimated, in which those who
      were not exposed to AAD served as the comparison group. RESULTS: Acceptance and
      use of AAD among PCPs gradually increased over time but varied by specialty. AAD 
      was associated with an approximately 14% reduction in total cost of care during
      the first month of follow-up and a 20% reduction (P <.001) during the second
      month. These reductions in cost of care appeared to be driven by reductions in
      emergency department visits and physician office visits. CONCLUSIONS: Geisinger's
      AAD experience suggests that the integration of primary and specialty care via
      the use of a highly reliable and efficient asynchronous communication system can 
      potentially lead to reductions in avoidable care and more efficient use of
      specialty care.

TI  - From research to evidence-informed decision making: a systematic approach.
PG  - i3-i12
LID - 10.1093/pubmed/fdx153 [doi]
AB  - Background: Knowledge creation forms an integral part of the knowledge-to-action 
      framework aimed at bridging the gap between research and evidence-informed
      decision making. Although principles of science communication, data visualisation
      and user-centred design largely impact the effectiveness of communication, their 
      role in knowledge creation is still limited. Hence, this article aims to provide 
      researchers a systematic approach on how knowledge creation can be put into
      practice. Methods: A systematic two-phased approach towards knowledge creation
      was formulated and executed. First, during a preparation phase the purpose and
      audience of the knowledge were defined. Subsequently, a developmental phase
      facilitated how the content is 'said' (language) and communicated (channel). This
      developmental phase proceeded via two pathways: a translational cycle and design 
      cycle, during which core translational and design components were incorporated.
      The entire approach was demonstrated by a case study. Results: The case study
      demonstrated how the phases in this systematic approach can be operationalised.
      It furthermore illustrated how created knowledge can be delivered. Conclusion:
      The proposed approach offers researchers a systematic, practical and
      easy-to-implement tool to facilitate effective knowledge creation towards
      decision-makers in healthcare. Through the integration of core components of
      knowledge creation evidence-informed decision making will ultimately be
      optimized.

TI  - An HL7 FHIR and GraphQL approach for interoperability between heterogeneous
      Electronic Health Record systems.
PG  - 14604582211043920
LID - 10.1177/14604582211043920 [doi]
AB  - Heterogeneities in data representation and care processes create interoperability
      complexity among Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs). We can resolve such
      data and process level heterogeneities by following consistent healthcare
      standards like Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), OpenEHR, and HL7 FHIR.
      However, these standards also differ at the structural and implementation level, 
      making interoperability more complex. Hence, there is a need to investigate
      mechanisms that can resolve data level heterogeneity to achieve semantic data
      interoperability between heterogeneous systems. As a solution to this, we offer
      an architecture that utilizes a resource server based on GraphQL and HL7 FHIR
      that establishes communication between two heterogeneous EHRs. This paper
      describes how the proposed architecture is implemented to achieve
      interoperability between two heterogeneous EHRs, HL7 FHIR and OpenMRS. The
      presented approach establishes secure communication between the EHRs and provides
      accurate mappings that enable timely health information exchange between EHRs.

TI  - Achieving Efficient and Privacy-Preserving k-NN Query for Outsourced eHealthcare 
      Data.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1229-1 [doi]
AB  - The boom of Internet of Things devices promotes huge volumes of eHealthcare data 
      will be collected and aggregated at eHealthcare provider. With the help of these 
      health data, eHealthcare provider can offer reliable data service (e.g., k-NN
      query) to doctors for better diagnosis. However, the IT facility in the
      eHealthcare provider is incompetent with the huge volumes of eHealthcare data, so
      one popular solution is to deploy a powerful cloud and appoint the cloud to
      execute the k-NN query service. In this case, since the eHealthcare data are very
      sensitive yet cloud servers are not fully trusted, directly executing the k-NN
      query service in the cloud inevitably incurs privacy challenges. Apart from the
      privacy issues, efficiency issues also need to be taken into consideration
      because achieving privacy requirement will incur additional computational cost.
      However, existing focuses on k-NN query do not (fully) consider the data privacy 
      or are inefficient. For instance, the best computational complexity of k-NN query
      over encrypted eHealthcare data in the cloud is as large as [Formula: see text], 
      where N is the total number of data. In this paper, aiming at addressing the
      privacy and efficiency challenges, we design an efficient and privacy-preserving 
      k-NN query scheme for encrypted outsourced eHealthcare data. Our proposed scheme 
      is characterized by integrating the k d-tree with the homomorphic encryption
      technique for efficient storing encrypted data in the cloud and processing
      privacy-preserving k-NN query over encrypted data. Compared with existing works, 
      our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of privacy-preserving k-NN query. 
      Specifically, our proposed scheme can achieve k-NN computation over encrypted
      data with [Formula: see text] computational complexity, where l and N
      respectively denote the data dimension and the total number of data. In addition,
      detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is really
      privacy-preserving under our security model and performance evaluation also
      indicates that our proposed scheme is indeed efficient in terms of computational 
      cost.

TI  - Enabling health information exchange at a US Poison Control Center.
PG  - 1000-1006
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa055 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was to enable poison control center
      (PCC) participation in standards-based health information exchange (HIE).
      Previously, PCC participation was not possible due to software noncompliance with
      HIE standards, lack of informatics infrastructure, and the need to integrate HIE 
      processes into workflow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted the Health Level Seven
      Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) consultation note for the PCC
      use case. We used rapid prototyping to determine requirements for an HIE
      dashboard for use by PCCs and developed software called SNOWHITE that enables
      poison center HIE in tandem with a poisoning information system. RESULTS: We
      successfully implemented the process and software at the PCC and began sending
      outbound C-CDAs from the Utah PCC on February 15, 2017; we began receiving
      inbound C-CDAs on October 30, 2018. DISCUSSION: With the creation of SNOWHITE and
      initiation of an HIE process for sending outgoing C-CDA consultation notes from
      the Utah Poison Control Center, we accomplished the first participation of PCCs
      in standards-based HIE in the US. We faced several challenges that are also
      likely to be present at PCCs in other states, including the lack of a robust set 
      of patient identifiers to support automated patient identity matching, challenges
      in emergency department computerized workflow integration, and the need to build 
      HIE software for PCCs. CONCLUSION: As a multi-disciplinary, multi-organizational 
      team, we successfully developed both a process and the informatics tools
      necessary to enable PCC participation in standards-based HIE and implemented the 
      process at the Utah PCC.

TI  - Design of a Secure Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for Smart Healthcare.
PG  - 133
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1251-3 [doi]
AB  - Now-a-days, the society is witnessing a keen urge to enhance the quality of
      healthcare services with the intervention of technology in the health sector. The
      main focus in transforming traditional healthcare to smart healthcare is on
      facilitating the patients as well as medical professionals. However, this
      changover is not easy due to various issues of security and integrity associated 
      with it. Security of patients's personal health record and privacy can be handled
      well by permitting only authorized access to the confidential health-data via
      suitably designed authentication scheme. In pursuit to contribute in this
      direction, we came across the role of Universal Serial Bus (USB), the most widely
      accepted interface, in enabling communication between peripheral devices and a
      host controller like laptop, personal computer, smart phone, tablet etc. In the
      process, we analysed a recently proposed a three-factor authentication scheme for
      consumer USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD) by He et al. In this paper, we
      demonstrate that He et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to leakage of temporary but
      session specific information attacks, late detection of message replay, forward
      secrecy attacks, and backward secrecy attacks. Then motivated with the benefits
      of USB, we propose a secure three-factor authentication scheme for smart
      healthcare.

TI  - Discordance in Information Exchange Between Providers During Care Transitions for
      Surgical Patients.
PG  - 174-180
LID - S0022-4804(19)30445-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jss.2019.06.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The exchange of health information between primary care providers
      (PCPs) and surgeons is critical during transitions of care for older patients
      with multiple comorbidities; however, it is unknown to what extent this process
      occurs. This study was designed to characterize the extent to which factors
      associated with older patient's recovery, such as functional status, cognitive
      status, social status, and emotional factors, are shared among PCPs and surgical 
      providers during care transitions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively
      identified 15 patients aged over 60 y with >/=3 comorbidities referred for
      general and vascular surgery procedures at a Veterans Administrative and academic
      medical center. Semistructured Critical Decision Method interviews were conducted
      with patients along with their surgical providers and referring PCPs. Thematic
      content analysis was performed independently by five reviewers on the cognitive
      processes associated with functional status, cognitive status, social status, and
      emotional factors. Interrater reliability between providers and patients was
      assessed using Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: Forty-seven Critical Decision Method
      interviews were conducted, which included 20 paired interviews between a PCP and 
      a surgeon and 16 paired interviews that involved a patient and a provider. The
      majority of patients reported experiencing poor information exchange between
      their PCP and surgeon (58%) and feeling they were primarily responsible for
      communicating their own health information during care transitions (67%). In
      paired interviews between PCPs and surgeons, there was nearly perfect agreement
      for the shared knowledge of cognitive (kappa: 0.83) and emotional (kappa 1)
      factors. In contrast, there was only minimal agreement for shared knowledge of
      functional status (kappa 0.38) and social status (kappa: 0.34). CONCLUSIONS:
      Information exchange between PCPs and surgical providers is often discordant
      during transitions of surgical care for medically complex older patients,
      particularly when it pertains to communicating their functional or social status.

TI  - How Does Electronic Health Information Exchange Affect Hospital Performance
      Efficiency? The Effects of Breadth and Depth of Information Sharing.
PG  - 212-228
LID - 10.1097/JHM-D-16-00041 [doi]
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: This research was motivated by the large investment in health 
      information technology (IT) by hospitals and the inconsistent findings related to
      the effects of health IT adoption on hospital performance. Building on resource
      orchestration theory and the information systems literature, the authors
      developed a research model to investigate how the configuration strategies for
      sharing information under health IT systems affect hospital efficiency. The
      hypotheses were tested using data from the 2010 annual and IT surveys of the
      American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services case mix 
      index, and U.S. Census Bureau's small-area income and poverty estimates. The
      study revealed that in health IT systems, the breadth (extent) and depth (level
      of detail) of digital information sharing among stakeholders each has a
      curvilinear relationship with hospital efficiency. In addition, breadth and depth
      reinforce each other's positive effects and attenuate each other's negative
      effects, and their balance has a positive effect on hospital efficiency. The
      results of this research have the potential to enrich the literature on the value
      of adopting health IT systems as well as in providing practitioner guidelines for
      meaningful use.

TI  - Racial differences in patient consent policy preferences for electronic health
      information exchange.
PG  - 717-725
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between demographic
      variables, such as race and gender, and patient consent policy preferences for
      health information exchange as well as self-report by VHA enrollees of
      information continuity between Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and community
      non-VHA heath care providers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected between 
      March 25, 2016 and August 22, 2016 in an online survey of 19 567 veterans. Three 
      questions from the 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey,
      which addressed care continuity, were included. The survey also included
      questions about consent policy preference regarding opt-out, opt-in, and "break
      the glass" consent policies. RESULTS: VHA enrollees had comparable proportions of
      unnecessary laboratory testing and conflicting information from providers when
      compared with the United States sample in the Commonwealth Survey. However, they 
      endorsed medical record information being unavailable between organizations more 
      highly. Demographic variables were associated with gaps in care continuity as
      well as consent policy preferences, with 56.8% of Whites preferring an opt-out
      policy as compared with 40.3% of Blacks, 44.9% of Hispanic Latinos, 48.3% of
      Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 38.3% of Native Americans (P < .001). DISCUSSION:
      Observed large differences by race and ethnicity in privacy preferences for
      electronic health information exchange should inform implementation of these
      programs to ensure cultural sensitivity. Veterans experienced care continuity
      comparable to a general United States sample, except for less effective exchange 
      of health records between heath care organizations. VHA followed an opt-in
      consent policy at the time of this survey which may underlie this gap.

TI  - Usage and accuracy of medication data from nationwide health information exchange
      in Quebec, Canada.
PG  - 722-729
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy015 [doi]
AB  - Objective: (1) To describe the usage of medication data from the Health
      Information Exchange (HIE) at the health care system level in the province of
      Quebec; (2) To assess the accuracy of the medication list obtained from the HIE. 
      Methods: A descriptive study was conducted utilizing usage data obtained from the
      Ministry of Health at the individual provider level from January 1 to December
      31, 2015. Usage patterns by role, type of site, and tool used to access the HIE
      were investigated. The list of medications of 111 high risk patients arriving at 
      the emergency department of an academic healthcare center was obtained from the
      HIE and compared with the list obtained through the medication reconciliation
      process. Results: There were 31 022 distinct users accessing the HIE 11 085 653
      times in 2015. The vast majority of pharmacists and general practitioners
      accessed it, compared to a minority of specialists and nurses. The top 1% of
      users was responsible of 19% of access. Also, 63% of the access was made using
      the Viewer application, while using a certified electronic medical record
      application seemed to facilitate usage. Among 111 patients, 71 (64%) had at least
      one discrepancy between the medication list obtained from the HIE and the
      reference list. Conclusions: Early adopters were mostly in primary care settings,
      and were accessing it more frequently when using a certified electronic medical
      record. Further work is needed to investigate how to resolve accuracy issues with
      the medication list and how certain tools provide different features.

TI  - The complementary nature of query-based and directed health information exchange 
      in primary care practice.
PG  - 73-80
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz134 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many policymakers and advocates assume that directed and query-based
      health information exchange (HIE) work together to meet organizations'
      interoperability needs, but this is not grounded in a substantial evidence base. 
      This study sought to clarify the relationship between the usage of these 2
      approaches to HIE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: System user log files from a regional
      HIE organization and electronic health record system were combined to model the
      usage of HIE associated with a patient visit at 3 federally qualified health
      centers in New York. Regression models tested the hypothesis that directed HIE
      usage was associated with query-based usage and adjusted for factors reflective
      of the FITT (Fit between Individuals, Task & Technology) framework. Follow-up
      interviews with 8 key informants helped interpret findings. RESULTS: Usage of
      query-based HIE occurred in 3.1% of encounters and directed HIE in 23.5%.
      Query-based usage was 0.6 percentage points higher when directed HIE provided
      imaging information, and 4.8 percentage points higher when directed HIE provided 
      clinical documents. The probability of query-based HIE was lower for specialist
      visits, higher for postdischarge visits, and higher for encounters with nurse
      practitioners. Informants used query-based HIE after directed HIE to obtain
      additional information, support transitions of care, or in cases of abnormal
      results. DISCUSSION: The complementary nature of directed and query-based HIE
      indicates that both HIE functionalities should be incorporated into EHR
      Certification Criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative findings
      suggest that directed and query-based HIE exist in a complementary manner in
      ambulatory care settings.

TI  - The Association Between State-Level Health Information Exchange Laws and Hospital
      Participation in Community Health Information Organizations.
PG  - 313-320
AB  - Evidence suggests that health information exchange (HIE) is an effective strategy
      to improve efficiency and quality of care, as well as reduce costs. A complex
      patchwork of federal and state legislation has developed over time to encourage
      HIE activity. Hospitals and health systems have adopted various HIE models to
      meet the requirements of these statutes and regulations. Given the complexity of 
      HIE laws, it is important to understand how these legal levers influence HIE
      engagement. We combined data from two unique data sources to examine the
      association between state-level HIE laws and hospital engagement in community
      HIEs. Our results identified three legal provisions of state laws (HIE
      authorization, financial & non-financial incentives, opt-out consent) that
      increased the likelihood of community HIE engagement. Other provisions decreased 
      the likelihood of engagement. This analysis provides foundational evidence about 
      the utility of HIE laws. More research is needed to determine causal
      relationships.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health is poorer in rural areas and a major challenge is care
      coordination for complex chronic conditions. The HITECH and 21(st) Century Cure
      Acts emphasize health information exchange which underpins activities required to
      improve care coordination. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Using semi-structured
      interviews and surveys, we examined how providers experience electronic health
      information exchange during care coordination since these Acts were implemented, 
      with a focus on rural settings where health disparities exist. We used a
      purposive sample that included primary care, acute care hospitals, and community 
      health services in the United States. FINDINGS: We identified seven themes
      related to care coordination and information exchange: 'insufficient trust of
      data'; 'please respond'; 'just fax it'; 'care plans'; 'needle in the haystack';
      're-documentation'; and 'rural reality'. These gaps were magnified when
      information exchange was required between unaffiliated electronic health records 
      (EHRs) about shared patients, which was more pronounced in rural settings.
      CONCLUSION: Policy and incentive modifications are likely needed to overcome the 
      observed health information technology (HIT) shortcomings. Rural settings in the 
      United States accentuate problems that can be addressed through international
      medical informatics policy makers and the implementation and evaluation of
      interoperable HIT systems.

TI  - Hospitals' adoption of intra-system information exchange is negatively associated
      with inter-system information exchange.
PG  - 1189-1196
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy058 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: U.S. policy on interoperable HIT has focused on increasing
      inter-system (ie, between different organizations) health information exchange.
      However, interoperable HIT also supports the movement of information within the
      same organization (ie, intra-system exchange). Methods: We examined the
      relationship between hospitals' intra- and inter-system information exchange
      capabilities among health system hospitals included in the 2010-2014 American
      Hospital Association's Annual Health Information Technology Survey. We described 
      the factors associated with hospitals that adopted more intra-system than
      inter-system exchange capability, and explored the extent of new capability
      adoption among hospitals that reported neither intra- or inter-system information
      capabilities at baseline. Results: The prevalence of exchange increased over
      time, but the adoption of inter-system information exchange was slower; when
      hospitals adopt information exchange, adoption of intra-system exchange was more 
      common. On average during our study period, hospitals could share 4.6 types of
      information by intra-system exchange, but only 2.7 types of information by
      inter-system exchange. Controlling for other factors, hospitals exchanged more
      types of information in an intra-system manner than inter-system when the number 
      of different inpatient EHR vendors in use in health system is larger. Conclusion:
      Consistent with the U.S. goals for more widely accessible patient information,
      hospitals' ability to share information has increased over time. However,
      hospitals are prioritizing within-organizational information exchange over
      exchange between different organizations. If increasing inter-system exchanges is
      a desired goal, current market incentives and government policies may be
      insufficient to overcome hospitals' motivations for pursuing an
      intra-system-information-exchange-first strategy.

TI  - Health information needs of pregnant women: information sources, motives and
      barriers.
PG  - 24-37
LID - 10.1111/hir.12200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women should be provided with relevant and useful
      information to manage this specific period of their lives. Assessing information 
      needs of this group is a prerequisite for providing this information. OBJECTIVE: 
      The aim of this study was to assess the information needs of pregnant women
      during their pregnancy and childbirth. METHODS: This descriptive study was
      conducted on the pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics and
      obstetricians/gynaecologists' offices in Kerman, Iran, in 2015. Data were
      collected using a self-administered, valid and reliable questionnaire. A total of
      400 women participated in the study. FINDINGS: Most pregnant women needed
      information about care of the foetus (n = 344, 86%), physical and psychological
      complications after delivery (n = 333, 83%), development and growth of the foetus
      (n = 330, 82.5%), pregnancy nutrition (n = 327, 82%) and special tests during
      pregnancy (n = 326, 81.5%). They mostly (n = 195, 49%) looked for information
      when they were suffering from a disease or pregnancy complications. CONCLUSIONS: 
      As pregnant women need extensive information to be able to take care of
      themselves and their babies, their information needs should be identified and
      taken into consideration when planning educational programmes for this group of
      women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing population of health information consumers
      (HIC) with multiple conditions (multimorbid). Previous studies explored the
      online behavior of HIC in general or HIC with a specific disease; however, the
      behavior of multimorbid HIC remains poorly researched. OBJECTIVES: This research 
      aims to investigate the behaviors of the multimorbid HIC on community Q&A
      platforms. METHODS: Using kidney disease, a prevalent disease with high
      likelihood of multimorbidity as a case, we analyzed the online interaction
      behaviors of HIC with multimorbidity in Quora, a community Q&A platform, and
      compared them to those of single-disease HIC. RESULTS: The findings of this study
      reveal significant differences in the online interaction behavior between HIC of 
      single vs. multimorbid diseases. Compared with single-disease HIC, multimorbid
      HIC are more active in multiple aspects, such as asking questions, following
      different topics or users, and providing suggestions for improvement of questions
      and answers. Additionally, multimorbid HIC are more likely to add topics to their
      questions, and their questions tend to attract more answers than those of
      single-disease HIC. On the other hand, questions and answers provided from single
      disease HIC had more views, followers, and upvotes than those from multimorbid
      HIC. CONCLUSION: The high level of activity among multimorbid HIC can be
      explained by their complex needs for information, driving an increased number of 
      questions and drawing more attention from the whole community in answering them. 
      Multimorbid HIC appear to be valuable contributors to the online community and
      reasons for the reduced visibility and upvoting of their answers should be
      investigated.

PG  - 168-178
LID - 10.1111/hir.12257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Timely access to evidence increases the prospects for evidence
      informed decision making. We evaluated user experiences of a Clearing House for
      Health Policy with the aim of increasing access to evidence about the Uganda
      health system and interventions. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with
      15 potential users including policymakers, health policy advisors, health
      managers and researchers to provide evidence on their experience with the
      clearinghouse. On average participants took 20 minutes to first navigate the site
      and 45 minutes to perform search tasks and complete the interview. RESULTS: Most 
      respondents successfully searched for information with accuracy and completeness 
      in a short time. Participants commended the performance and expressed high regard
      for the credibility of the clearinghouse. The majority felt that using the
      resource was worth their effort. The clearinghouse provided appropriate
      functionalities for information searching. Navigating and finding information
      from the site was achievable. However, inadequate background information about
      the site and lack of current information were widely reported. CONCLUSION: Our
      paper provides insights on the issues that can be addressed to improve online
      resources for health policy and system information in a limited resource setting.
      Users' experience of such resources can be improved by regularly appraising and
      appropriately indexing the contents, and optimising the capacity to customise
      information.

TI  - Implementing Prudent Healthcare in the NHS in Wales; what are the barriers and
      enablers for clinicians?
PG  - 104-110
LID - 10.1111/jep.13023 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Prudent Healthcare is a strategy adopted by the Welsh Government in
      response to the challenge of improving health care during times of austerity and 
      when needs and demand are rising. Four principles underlie Prudent Healthcare: to
      achieve health and wellbeing through co production; care for those with the
      greatest health needs first; do only what is needed; and reduce inappropriate
      variation. For Prudent Healthcare to be implemented in Wales, it is necessary for
      health professionals to adopt these principles in practice. OBJECTIVE: This paper
      reports a qualitative evaluation of clinicians' awareness, experiences, and views
      about Prudent Healthcare, identifying barriers and enablers to implementation
      from the clinician's perspective. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 28)
      and five focus groups (with 23 participants) were undertaken with a diverse range
      of health professionals working in primary and secondary care. Analysis was
      underpinned by the COM-B model which provides a framework to understand behaviour
      change in context using three domains, Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation.
      RESULTS: Clinicians reported the importance and challenges of accessing and
      sharing information and evidence to inform practice (Capability). Reduced
      staffing levels and service availability were highlighted as possible barriers to
      Prudent Healthcare implementation while multidisciplinary working and
      reorganization of staff roles and services were considered enablers
      (Opportunity). Finally, although the principles of Prudent Healthcare were
      broadly welcomed (Motivation), a lack of awareness of the initiative and the
      management of patient expectations presented barriers. CONCLUSION: While there
      was a positive response and widespread support for the principles of Prudent
      Healthcare by clinicians, increasing awareness of the initiative and improvement 
      to systems to enable information sharing and the monitoring of patient outcomes
      could improve the consistency of implementation.

TI  - Impact of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program on Health Information Exchange
      Utilization, Prescribing Behaviors, and Care Coordination in an Emergency

PG  - 647-654
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000566 [doi]
AB  - Timely access to patient data is critical in patient care. The utilization of
      health information exchange and prescription drug monitoring programs can make
      pertinent data readily accessible for emergency department providers to
      coordinate care. A quasi-experimental preintervention-postintervention design,
      with 62 providers and 53 554 emergency department visits linked to a health
      information exchange and prescription drug monitoring program, was used to
      evaluate rates for utilization, laboratory/imaging orders, narcotic prescribing
      and readmission. Health information exchange utilization increased significantly 
      after the drug monitoring program was implemented (mean = 119.33 to mean =
      231.33, t2 = -15.79, P < .001). There was no significant effect postprescription 
      drug monitoring program for laboratory/imaging orders or narcotics at discharge, 
      although narcotic orders during emergency visits increased (F1,23 = 7.953, P =
      .010), which may suggest the data confirmed the immediate need to control acute
      or chronic conditions. In addition, readmission rates decreased from 14.64% to
      12.58%. Through streamlining processes, health information exchange and
      prescription drug monitoring program usage were increased, which can improve
      care. As organizations promote interoperability of health information, the nurse 
      informaticist plays a significant role in managing access to systems that can
      assist all providers in coordinating care.

TI  - Parents' experiences of videoconference as a tool for multidisciplinary
      information exchange for children with epilepsy and disability.
PG  - 1506-1516
LID - 10.1111/jocn.14755 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the parents' experiences with the
      multidisciplinary information exchange between different levels of the health-
      social and school services using videoconference. BACKGROUND: Children with
      epilepsy and disability are in need of long-term multidisciplinary help and
      support. The information exchange between the child's providers of support is
      challenging. Scant attention has been paid to the parents' experiences of the
      information exchange. DESIGN: A qualitative study with a
      phenomenological-hermeneutical research approach. METHOD: Children with epilepsy 
      and disability had undergone a multidisciplinary assessment in a hospital in the 
      tertiary health service followed by information exchange with each child's local 
      support service using videoconference. Five parents were interviewed individually
      within a week after the videoconference. The COREQ checklist was used in the
      process of reporting on the empirical material. RESULTS: The increased local
      participation in the videoconference and the knowledge translation between the
      professionals made the parents save time, as they did not have to explain the
      written reports to each provider locally. The impact of technology created an
      emotional distance to the person on the screen and the information exchanged that
      some enjoyed while others disliked. The quality of the relationships to the
      professionals seemed to be crucial for the parents to feel safe talking about
      sensitive tasks. CONCLUSION: The parents prefer videoconference as a tool for
      information exchange to traditional face-to-face meetings as it enables
      discussions between professionals that might prevent treatment misunderstandings.
      They experience the method as time-saving and patient-centred. RELEVANCE TO
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: Professionals should be aware of the possible side effects of 
      the impact of technology that might affect the interaction and the information
      exchange in a negative way. The findings are likely to be transferable beyond the
      current context.

TI  - Sharing ICU Patient Data Responsibly Under the Society of Critical Care
      Medicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Joint Data Science
      Collaboration: The Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database (AmsterdamUMCdb)
      Example.
PG  - e563-e577
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004916 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Critical care medicine is a natural environment for machine learning 
      approaches to improve outcomes for critically ill patients as admissions to ICUs 
      generate vast amounts of data. However, technical, legal, ethical, and privacy
      concerns have so far limited the critical care medicine community from making
      these data readily available. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the
      European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have identified ICU patient data
      sharing as one of the priorities under their Joint Data Science Collaboration. To
      encourage ICUs worldwide to share their patient data responsibly, we now describe
      the development and release of Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database
      (AmsterdamUMCdb), the first freely available critical care database in full
      compliance with privacy laws from both the United States and Europe, as an
      example of the feasibility of sharing complex critical care data. SETTING:
      University hospital ICU. SUBJECTS: Data from ICU patients admitted between 2003
      and 2016. INTERVENTIONS: We used a risk-based deidentification strategy to
      maintain data utility while preserving privacy. In addition, we implemented
      contractual and governance processes, and a communication strategy. Patient
      organizations, supporting hospitals, and experts on ethics and privacy audited
      these processes and the database. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: AmsterdamUMCdb
      contains approximately 1 billion clinical data points from 23,106 admissions of
      20,109 patients. The privacy audit concluded that reidentification is not
      reasonably likely, and AmsterdamUMCdb can therefore be considered as anonymous
      information, both in the context of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation. The
      ethics audit concluded that responsible data sharing imposes minimal burden,
      whereas the potential benefit is tremendous. CONCLUSIONS: Technical, legal,
      ethical, and privacy challenges related to responsible data sharing can be
      addressed using a multidisciplinary approach. A risk-based deidentification
      strategy, that complies with both U.S. and European privacy regulations, should
      be the preferred approach to releasing ICU patient data. This supports the shared
      Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine
      vision to improve critical care outcomes through scientific inquiry of vast and
      combined ICU datasets.

TI  - One country's journey to interoperability: Tanzania's experience developing and
      implementing a national health information exchange.
PG  - 139
LID - 10.1186/s12911-021-01499-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robust, flexible, and integrated health information (HIS) systems are
      essential to achieving national and international goals in health and
      development. Such systems are still uncommon in most low and middle income
      countries. This article describes a first-phase activity in Tanzania to integrate
      the country's vertical health management information system with the help of an
      interoperability layer that enables cross-program data exchange. METHODS: From
      2014 to 2019, the Tanzanian government and partners implemented a five-step
      procedure based on the "Mind the GAPS" (governance, architecture, program
      management, and standards) framework and using both proprietary and open-source
      tools. In collaboration with multiple stakeholders, the team developed the system
      to address major data challenges via four fully documented "use case scenarios"
      addressing data exchange among hospitals, between services and the supply chain, 
      across digital data systems, and within the supply chain reporting system. This
      work included developing the architecture for health system data exchange,
      putting a middleware interoperability layer in place to facilitate the exchange, 
      and training to support use of the system and the data it generates. RESULTS:
      Tanzania successfully completed the five-step procedure for all four use cases.
      Data exchange is currently enabled among 15 separate information systems, and has
      resulted in improved data availability and significant time savings. The
      government has adopted the health information exchange within the national
      strategy for health care information, and the system is being operated and
      managed by Tanzanian officials. CONCLUSION: Developing an integrated HIS requires
      a significant time investment; but ultimately benefit both programs and patients.
      Tanzania's experience may interest countries that are developing their HIS
      programs.

TI  - Health information exchange between hospital and skilled nursing facilities not
      associated with lower readmissions.
PG  - 1335-1345
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13210 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether an electronic health record (EHR) portal to enable
      health information exchange (HIE) between a hospital and three skilled nursing
      facilities (SNFs) reduced likelihood of patient readmission. SETTING/DATA:
      Secondary data; all discharges from a large academic medical center to SNFs
      between July 2013 and March 2017, combined with portal usage records from SNFs
      with HIE access. DESIGN: We use difference-in-differences to determine whether
      portal implementation reduced likelihood of readmission over time for patients
      discharged to HIE-enabled SNFs, relative to those discharged to nonenabled
      facilities. Additional descriptive analyses of audit log data characterize portal
      use within enabled facilities. DATA COLLECTION: Encounter-level clinical EHR data
      were merged with EHR audit log data that captured portal usage in the timeframe
      associated with a patient transition from hospital to SNF. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
      Declines in likelihood of 30-day readmission were not significantly different for
      patients in HIE-enabled vs control SNFs (diff-in-diff = 0.022; P = .431). We
      observe similar null effects with shorter readmission windows. The portal was
      used for 46 percent of discharges, with significant usage pattern variation
      within/across facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a hospital-SNF EHR
      portal did not reduce readmissions from enabled SNFs. Emergent HIE use cases need
      to be better defined and leveraged for design and implementation that generates
      value in the context of postacute transitions.

TI  - Detecting Undiagnosed Diabetes: Proof-of-Concept Based on the Health-Information 
      Exchange System of the Veneto Region (North-East Italy).
PG  - 4293-4296
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857608 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a chronic illness characterised by elevated blood glucose levels,
      driving excess mortality. Its prompt detection and accurate management are
      critical for delaying complications. Nevertheless, diabetes can remain
      undiagnosed for years from the onset. The identification of undiagnosed diabetes 
      is a public health priority: in Italy, it is estimated that up to 30% of diabetes
      cases remain undetected, i.e., that ~1.8 million citizens may be unaware they
      need medical help. Sometimes, this happens even though these subjects undergo
      routine or emergency check-ups. Veneto, a region in North-East Italy with 4.9
      million residents, implements a regional Health Information Exchange system
      (rHIE) to collect healthcare data, including laboratory reports, and integrate
      them with administrative claims. Their combination may be instrumental in finding
      otherwise undetected cases of diabetes. On the one hand, known diabetic patients 
      should have disease management-generated claims; on the other, laboratory test
      results can be independently evaluated against diagnostic criteria. In the
      present work, we examined the anonymised claims and laboratory data, extracted
      from the rHIE, of 23,376 citizens of the Veneto region. We compared their
      exemptions, diabetes-related hospitalisation discharge codes, and antidiabetic
      drugs between 2012 and 2018 to the results of their fasting glucose, glycated
      haemoglobin, and oral glucose tolerance tests in 2017-2018. We identified 1,407
      (6.02%) subjects who, according to administrative claims, appear to be free from 
      diabetes, but met at least one laboratory diagnostic criterion. Such a
      discrepancy suggests that these people may be undiagnosed diabetic patients. To
      the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept of an automatic
      system for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes in Italy. Its full integration
      in the rHIE and its consequent capillary application could potentially reveal
      thousands of hidden cases throughout Veneto.

      outpatient, and emergency settings.

AB  - Prior research on health information exchange (HIE) typically measured provider
      usage through surveys or they summarized the availability of HIE services in a
      healthcare organization. Few studies utilized user log files. Using HIE access
      log files, we measured HIE use in real-world clinical settings over a 7-year
      period (2011-2017). Use of HIE increased in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency 
      department (ED) settings. Further, while extant literature has generally viewed
      the ED as the most relevant setting for HIE, the greatest change in HIE use was
      observed in the inpatient setting, followed by the ED setting and then the
      outpatient setting. Our findings suggest that in addition to federal incentives, 
      the implementation of features that address barriers to access (eg, Single Sign
      On), as well as value-added services (eg, interoperability with external data
      sources), may be related to the growth in user-initiated HIE.

TI  - A Population Health Measurement Framework: Evidence-Based Metrics for Assessing
      Community-Level Population Health in the Global Budget Context.
PG  - 261-270
LID - 10.1089/pop.2017.0112 [doi]
AB  - Population health is one of the pillars of the Triple Aim to improve US health
      care. The authors developed a framework for population health measurement and a
      proposed set of measures for further exploration to guide the population health
      efforts in Maryland. The authors searched peer-reviewed, expert-authored
      literature and current public health measures. Using a semi-structured analysis, 
      a framework was proposed, which consisted of a conceptual model of several
      domains and identified population health measures addressing them. Stakeholders
      were convened to review the framework and identified the most feasible population
      health measures considering the underlying health information technology (IT)
      infrastructure in Maryland. The framework was organized based on health system
      factors, determinants of health, and population-based and clinical outcomes.
      Measurement specifications were developed that addressed different aspects of
      selected measures and assessed various national and local data sources for
      selected measures. Data sources were identified based on their key
      characteristics, challenges, opportunities, and potential applicability to the
      proposed measures, as well as the issue of interoperability of data sources among
      different organizations. The proposed framework and measures can act as a
      platform to quantify the determinants of health and the state overall population 
      health goals. Key considerations for developing a population health measures
      framework include health IT infrastructure, data denominators, feasibility,
      health system environment, and policy factors. Measurement development and
      progression using the framework will largely depend on the users' focus areas and
      availability of data. The authors believe that the proposed framework and road
      map can serve as a model for communities elsewhere.

      Facilities and their Challenges: A Case of Uganda.
PG  - 1157-1166
AB  - Availability of an accurate and complete health facility list is fundamental in
      producing quality and timely data that is sufficient to aid evidence-based
      decision, resource allocation and planning within the healthcare ecosystem. This 
      study aimed at examining the approaches used in Uganda to manage data about
      health facilities and the challenges they are facing. We conducted a qualitative 
      study involving 32 interviews with participants from Ministry of Health,
      government regulatory organizations, district local government, general public,
      academia, implementing partners and healthcare providers. Our analysis identified
      four divergent approaches that had five common challenges, namely; lack of a
      health facility unique identifier, non-standardized, incomplete, inaccurate data,
      difficulty accessing and using data. Establishing a national central health
      facility registry to manage the national health facility list would improve
      patient referrals, facility look-ups, health information exchange, data curation 
      and access and health information system integration.

TI  - Discovering Clinical Information Models Online to Promote Interoperability of
      Electronic Health Records: A Feasibility Study of OpenEHR.
PG  - e13504
LID - 10.2196/13504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical information models (CIMs) enabling semantic interoperability
      are crucial for electronic health record (EHR) data use and reuse. Dual model
      methodology, which distinguishes the CIMs from the technical domain, could help
      enable the interoperability of EHRs at the knowledge level. How to help
      clinicians and domain experts discover CIMs from an open repository online to
      represent EHR data in a standard manner becomes important. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to develop a retrieval method to identify CIMs online to represent EHR
      data. METHODS: We proposed a graphical retrieval method and validated its
      feasibility using an online CIM repository: openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager
      (CKM). First, we represented CIMs (archetypes) using an extended Bayesian
      network. Then, an inference process was run in the network to discover relevant
      archetypes. In the evaluation, we defined three retrieval tasks (medication,
      laboratory test, and diagnosis) and compared our method with three typical
      retrieval methods (BM25F, simple Bayesian network, and CKM), using mean average
      precision (MAP), average precision (AP), and precision at 10 (P@10) as evaluation
      metrics. RESULTS: We downloaded all available archetypes from the CKM. Then, the 
      graphical model was applied to represent the archetypes as a four-level clinical 
      resources network. The network consisted of 5513 nodes, including 3982 data
      element nodes, 504 concept nodes, 504 duplicated concept nodes, and 523 archetype
      nodes, as well as 9867 edges. The results showed that our method achieved the
      best MAP (MAP=0.32), and the AP was almost equal across different retrieval tasks
      (AP=0.35, 0.31, and 0.30, respectively). In the diagnosis retrieval task, our
      method could successfully identify the models covering "diagnostic reports,"
      "problem list," "patients background," "clinical decision," etc, as well as
      models that other retrieval methods could not find, such as "problems and
      diagnoses." CONCLUSIONS: The graphical retrieval method we propose is an
      effective approach to meet the uncertainty of finding CIMs. Our method can help
      clinicians and domain experts identify CIMs to represent EHR data in a standard
      manner, enabling EHR data to be exchangeable and interoperable.

      Procedures Using an EMR-Independent System.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1150-z [doi]
AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to determine if the implementation of an
      actionable findings communication system (PeerVue) with explicitly defined
      criteria for the classification of critical results, leads to an increase in the 
      number of actionable findings reported by radiologists. Secondary goals are to 1)
      analyze the adoption rate of PeerVue and 2) assess the accuracy of the
      classification of actionable findings within this system. Over a two-year period,
      890,204 radiology reports were analyzed retrospectively in order to identify the 
      number of actionable findings communicated before (Year 1) and after the
      implementation of PeerVue (Year 2) at a tertiary care academic medical center. A 
      sub-sample of 145 actionable findings over a two-month period in Year 2 was
      further analyzed to assess the degree of concordance with our reporting policy.
      Before PeerVue, 4623/423,070 (1.09%) of radiology reports contained an actionable
      finding. After its implementation, this number increased to 6825/467,134 (1.46%) 
      (p < 0.0001). PeerVue was used in 3886/6825 (56.9%) cases with actionable
      findings. The remaining 2939/6825 (43.1%) were reported using the legacy tagging 
      system. From the sub-sample taken from PeerVue, 104/145 (71.7%) were consistent
      with the updated reporting policy. A software program (PeerVue) utilized for the 
      communication of actionable findings contributed to a 34% (p < 0.0001) increase
      in the reporting rate of actionable findings. A sub-analysis within the new
      system indicated a 56.9% adoption rate and a 71.7% accuracy rate in reporting of 
      actionable findings.

      the National Health Insurance PharmaCloud System in Taiwan.
LID - 8415 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18168415 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing physicians use of the
      PharmaCloud system in Taiwan through Technology Continuance Theory (TCT) and to
      construct a TCT-based structured questionnaire to demonstrate the attitude and
      behavior of physicians in the Taiwanese medical system. It focused on
      investigating "confirmation", "perceived usefulness", "perceived ease of use",
      "attitude", "satisfaction", and "continuance intention" towards the preload-based
      comparison and manual search in PharmaCloud by attending physicians during their 
      outpatient clinics. Path analysis was used to analyze the cause and effect
      relationship between variables. This study collected 528 valid questionnaires and
      the results of path analysis found that factors affecting physicians' continued
      use of preload-based comparison in PharmaCloud included "perceived usefulness",
      "satisfaction", and "attitude" (all p < 0.001); however, factors that influenced 
      physicians' continued use of manual search in PharmaCloud were only
      "satisfaction" and "attitude" (all p < 0.001). Additionally, the effects of
      "perceived usefulness" and "perceived ease of use" on "satisfaction" could only
      be seen in preload-based comparison in PharmaCloud. In conclusion, when
      physicians' actual use of PharmaCloud met their expectations, physicians had
      higher levels of confirmation and better perceived usefulness, which naturally
      increased their satisfaction and attitude towards PharmaCloud and positively
      prompted them to continue using it.

AB  - In light of the challenges posed by an ageing population and tighter public
      budgets, governments worldwide are seeking innovative ways of improving health
      service delivery. Volunteers can contribute to such improvement, but this
      requires effective coordination and communication between volunteers and
      healthcare employees. In this case study, conducted in two Norwegian
      municipalities during September-October 2017, the aim was to understand how
      collaboration and coordination is carried out between several stakeholders:
      volunteers, volunteer family members of healthcare service users and healthcare
      employees. Our results show that daily cooperation was largely unsystematic, and 
      stakeholders employed various informal communication procedures. Recruitment of
      volunteers was based on word of mouth and was coordinated by telephone and email.
      All processes were paper based, including contracting and confidential
      agreements. This unsystematic approach resulted in uncoordinated activities
      characterised by time-consuming processes, with no quality assurance. We
      concluded that stakeholders would benefit from a technology solution that
      supports more systematic processes of recruitment, management and monitoring.
      This article outlines the challenges and needs for information exchange and
      communication between stakeholders. Furthermore, it describes possible
      functionality in a digital system that can address these needs, and hence improve
      coordination, quality of services and resource use.

TI  - Kamishibai cards to sustain evidence-based practices to reduce
      healthcare-associated infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sustaining healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevention practices
      is complex. We examined the use of Kamishibai Cards (K Cards) as a tool to
      encourage compliance interactions between leaders and staff. METHODS: We explored
      one unit of a children's hospital to assess acceptability of K Cards.
      Interactions were recorded (n = 14), and interviews were conducted (n = 22). We
      used the Health Belief Model (HBM) for analyses. Central line utilization, bundle
      compliance and rates of HAIs were also examined. RESULTS: Staff members consider 
      K Card interactions reminders of bundle elements and acceptable for creating
      positive interactions. Although no causal inference can be made, during K Card
      implementation, CLABSI rates dropped from 1.83 in 2015 to 0.0 through June 2018. 
      Central line utilization decreased by 3%. DISCUSSION: Moving beyond theory to
      providing practical sustainability tools is an important implementation step.
      Although our findings are not generalizable, capturing what occurred on one unit 
      provides opportunity to discover how key leadership factors (communication and
      leadership style) influence the uptake, acceptability and sustained adoption of
      evidence-based practices. CONCLUSIONS: K Cards are a practical tool to sustain
      evidence-based practices and promote communication between leadership and staff -
      keeping compliance on the minds of frontline workers.

TI  - The associations between query-based and directed health information exchange
      with potentially avoidable use of health care services.
PG  - 981-993
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.13169 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of two approaches (directed and query-based) to
      health information exchange (HIE) on potentially avoidable use of health care
      services. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data on ambulatory care providers' adoption
      of HIE were merged with Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2008 to 2014.
      Providers were from 13 counties in New York served by the Rochester Regional
      Health Information Organization (RHIO). STUDY DESIGN: Linear regression models
      with provider and year fixed effects were used to estimate changes in the
      probability of utilization outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to
      providers adopting directed and/or query-based HIE compared with beneficiaries
      attributed to providers who had not adopted HIE. DATA COLLECTION: Providers' HIE 
      adoption status was determined through Rochester RHIO registration records. RHIO 
      and claims data were linked via National Provider Identifiers. PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Query-based HIE adoption was associated with a 0.2 percentage point
      reduction in the probability of an ambulatory care sensitive hospitalization and 
      a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of an unplanned readmission.
      Directed HIE adoption was not associated with any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) EHR certification criteria
      includes requirements for directed HIE, but not query-based HIE. Pending further 
      research, certification criteria should place equal weight on facilitating
      query-based and directed exchange.

TI  - Status of health information exchange: a comparison of six countries.
PG  - 0204279
LID - 10.7189/jogh.09.020427 [doi]
AB  - Background: Health information exchange (HIE) is frequently cited as an important
      objective of health information technology investment because of its potential to
      improve quality, reduce cost, and increase patient satisfaction. In this paper we
      examine the status and practices of HIE in six countries, drawn from a range of
      higher and lower income regions. Methods: For each of the countries represented -
      China, England, India, Scotland, Switzerland, and the United States - we describe
      the state of current practice of HIE with reference to two scenarios: transfer of
      care and referral. For each country we discuss national objectives, barriers and 
      plans for further advancing clinical information exchange. Results: The countries
      vary widely in levels of adoption of EHRs, availability of health information in 
      electronic form suitable for HIE, and in the information technology
      infrastructure to be used for transmission. Common themes emerged, however,
      including an expectation that information will be exchanged rather than gathered 
      anew, the need for incentives to promote information exchange, and concerns about
      data security and patient confidentiality. Conclusions: Although the ability to
      transfer health information to where it is most needed is nearly always mentioned
      as an advantage of HIE adoption, there are wide differences in the degree to
      which this has been achieved to support the scenarios used in this study.
      Nevertheless, these differences indicate varying stages of progress along a
      comparable pathway, with similar barriers being identified in the countries
      described. In some cases, these have been partially surmounted while elsewhere
      work is needed. We reflect on contextual factors influencing the status and
      direction of HIE efforts in different global regions and their implications for
      progress.

TI  - Diagnostic Discordance, Health Information Exchange, and Inter-Hospital Transfer 
      Outcomes: a Population Study.
PG  - 1447-1453
LID - 10.1007/s11606-018-4491-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studying diagnostic error at the population level requires an
      understanding of how diagnoses change over time. OBJECTIVE: To use inter-hospital
      transfers to examine the frequency and impact of changes in diagnosis on patient 
      risk, and whether health information exchange can improve patient safety by
      enhancing diagnostic accuracy. DESIGN: Diagnosis coding before and after hospital
      transfer was merged with responses from the American Hospital Association Annual 
      Survey for a cohort of patients transferred between hospitals to identify
      predictors of mortality. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (180,337) 18 years or older
      transferred between 473 acute care hospitals from NY, FL, IA, UT, and VT from
      2011 to 2013. MAIN MEASURES: We identified discordant Elixhauser comorbidities
      before and after transfer to determine the frequency and developed a weighted
      score of diagnostic discordance to predict mortality. This was included in a
      multivariate model with inpatient mortality as the dependent variable. We
      investigated whether health information exchange (HIE) functionality adoption as 
      reported by hospitals improved diagnostic discordance and inpatient mortality.
      KEY RESULTS: Discordance in diagnoses occurred in 85.5% of all patients.
      Seventy-three percent of patients gained a new diagnosis following transfer while
      47% of patients lost a diagnosis. Diagnostic discordance was associated with
      increased adjusted inpatient mortality (OR 1.11 95% CI 1.10-1.11, p < 0.001) and 
      allowed for improved mortality prediction. Bilateral hospital HIE participation
      was associated with reduced diagnostic discordance index (3.69 vs. 1.87%, p <
      0.001) and decreased inpatient mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic discordance commonly occurred during inter-hospital
      transfers and was associated with increased inpatient mortality. Health
      information exchange adoption was associated with decreased discordance and
      improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Facilitating Cancer Epidemiologic Efforts in Cleveland via Creation of
      Longitudinal De-Duplicated Patient Data Sets.
PG  - 787-795
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cleveland, Ohio, is home to three major hospital systems serving
      approximately 80% of the Northeast Ohio population. The Cleveland Clinic,
      University Hospitals Health System, and MetroHealth are direct competitors for
      primary and specialty care, and patient overlap between these systems is high.
      Fragmentation of health data that exist in silos at these health systems produces
      an overestimation of disease burden due to double and sometimes triple counting
      of patients. As a result, longitudinal population-based studies across the
      Cleveland patient population are impeded unless accurate and actionable
      clinically derived health data sets can be created. METHODS: The Cleveland
      Institute for Computational Biology has developed the De-Duplicate and
      De-Identify Research Engine (DeDeRE) that, without any exchange of personal
      health identifiers (PHI) between health systems, will effectively de-duplicate
      the patients between one or more health entities. RESULTS: The immediate utility 
      of this software for cancer epidemiology is the increased accuracy in measuring
      cancer burden and the potential to perform longitudinal studies with
      de-duplicated, de-identified data sets. CONCLUSIONS: The DeDeRE software
      developed and tested here accomplishes its goals without exposing PHIs using a
      state-of-the-art, trusted privacy preservation network enabled by a hash-based
      matching algorithm. IMPACT: This paper will guide the reader through the
      functions currently developed in DeDeRE and how a healthcare organization (HCO)
      employing the release version of this technology can begin sharing data with one 
      or more additional HCOs in a collaborative and noncompetitive manner to create a 
      regional population health resource for cancer researchers.See all articles in

TI  - Use of electronic health records from a statewide health information exchange to 
      support public health surveillance of diabetes and hypertension.
PG  - 1106
LID - 10.1186/s12889-019-7367-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) data, collected primarily for
      individual patient care and billing purposes, compiled in health information
      exchanges (HIEs) may have a secondary use for population health surveillance of
      noncommunicable diseases. However, data compilation across fragmented data
      sources into HIEs presents potential barriers and quality of data is unknown.
      METHODS: We compared 2015 patient data from a mid-size health system (Database A)
      to data from System A patients in the Utah HIE (Database B). We calculated
      concordance of structured data (sex and age) and unstructured data (blood
      pressure reading and A1C). We estimated adjusted hypertension and diabetes
      prevalence in each database and compared these across age groups. RESULTS:
      Matching resulted in 72,356 unique patients. Concordance between Database A and
      Database B exceeded 99% for sex and age, but was 89% for A1C results and 54% for 
      blood pressure readings. Sensitivity, using Database A as the standard, was 57%
      for hypertension and 55% for diabetes. Age and sex adjusted prevalence of
      diabetes (8.4% vs 5.8%, Database A and B, respectively) and hypertension (14.5%
      vs 11.6%, respectively) differed, but this difference was consistent with
      parallel slopes in prevalence over age groups in both databases. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identified several gaps in the use of HIE data for surveillance of diabetes and
      hypertension. High concordance of structured data demonstrate some promise in
      HIEs capacity to capture patient data. Improving HIE data quality through
      increased use of structured variables may help make HIE data useful for
      population health surveillance in places with fragmented EHR systems.

TI  - Health information seeking behaviors among individuals with young-onset and
      average-onset colorectal cancer: an international cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 6011-6021
LID - 10.1007/s00520-020-05446-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to evaluate health information seeking behaviors in
      yCRC (young onset colorectal cancer, diagnosed </= 50 years) and aCRC
      (average-age onset colorectal cancer, diagnosed >/= 50 years). METHODS: We
      administered an international, Internet-based survey to ask individuals diagnosed
      with CRC how they seek health information, including sources sought and
      utilization behaviors. We also asked participants their preferences for digital
      technologies. RESULTS: In total 1125 individuals including 455 with yCRC (68.6%
      female) and 670 with aCRC (53.5% female) participated. There were similar
      frequencies of seeking among participants with yCRC and aCRC across all sources
      except for the Internet. Healthcare providers were the most frequently sought
      source with similar proportions of participants indicating their response as
      "always" (yCRC, 43.7% vs. aCRC, 43.2%, p = 0.91). We also observed differences in
      utilization behaviors with more participants with yCRC using the Internet first
      when seeking information (yCRC 31.6% vs. aCRC 24.3%, p < 0.05) and those with
      aCRC seeking healthcare providers first (aCRC 61.9% vs. yCRC 45.5%, p < 0.05).
      With respect to digital technologies, we found a higher proportion of yCRC
      participants owning smartphones and indicating use of apps related to
      health/wellness and cancer. CONCLUSION: Individuals with yCRC and aCRC similarly 
      sought the same resources for health information on CRC. However, they differed
      with respect to utilization behaviors, particularly a greater reliance on digital
      technologies among individuals with yCRC. These have implications for informing
      age-specific resources and information to support patients.

TI  - Team-Based Health Information Exchange Use Increased Mammography Documentation
      and Referral in an Academic Primary Care Practice: An Interrupted Time Series.
PG  - 710-714
LID - 10.1007/s11606-017-4259-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of health information exchanges 
      (HIE) on quality in ambulatory settings. METHODS: From September 29, 2014, to
      September 4, 2015, we conducted an interrupted time series analysis of
      query-based use of the state HIE as part of team-based care to improve
      mammography screening in an academic primary care practice. Women aged 50-74
      years with a practice visit and who were eligible for mammography were included. 
      We conducted non-parametric data analysis using LOESS, followed by ARIMA
      analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 2020 visits among 904
      eligible patients, including 648 visits among 485 patients during 16 baseline
      weeks, and 1372 visits by 755 patients during 33 intervention weeks. During the
      intervention period, 16.0% of eligible women who were not up to date in our EHR
      had a mammogram in the HIE. Of eligible women, the proportion who had a
      documented up-to-date mammogram at the time of their visit increased by 11.3%,
      from 73.4% at baseline to 84.7% (p < 0.0001), the proportion who had mammography 
      addressed at the time of their visit increased by 42.7%, from 32.7% at baseline
      to 75.4% (p < 0.0001), and the proportion who were up to date at 8 weeks
      post-visit increased by 11.7%, from 76.3% at baseline to 88.0% (p < 0.0001).
      DISCUSSION: Query-based use of the state HIE as part of team-based care improved 
      documentation of mammography and led to an increase in the proportion of eligible
      women who received counseling on mammography screening in one primary care
      practice. These results suggest that HIE use in primary care could lead to
      improved delivery of other preventive services.

TI  - Stakeholders perspectives and deployment strategies of health information
      exchange illustrated through an in-depth case study of Pakistan.
PG  - 130-150
LID - 10.1080/17538157.2019.1582053 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ready access to reliable data is essential to support decision-making
      in patient care planning and delivery. Health information exchange (HIE), which
      is fundamental to achieve this, is currently limited in many low- and
      middle-income countries (LMICs), reflecting the lack of prioritization of this
      issue and the many barriers to its successful implementation.Objective: We sought
      to explore and understand stakeholders' perspectives on the context of and
      deployment strategies for HIE in Pakistan.Method: Data collection comprised
      interviews with purposefully selected groups of stakeholders across Pakistan,
      field notes, and a critical review of key national and international policy
      documents.Results: We identified reports of small pockets of effective HIE
      existing mainly in private hospitals, but in a patchy and fragmented form
      overall. Many problems were attributed to the absence of effective HIE, these
      ranging from 'delays in retrieving records' to contributing to 'the increase in
      antibiotic resistance'. The mindset of policymakers, poor infrastructure, lack of
      finance, training and data interoperability, and health-care providers'
      resistance to recording consultations due to poor documentation skills and
      concerns about liability considerations were highlighted as major barriers to
      HIE. Sharing regional health information with international organizations was
      perceived by some participants to increase the risk of regional espionage. A
      clear government policy directive for evidence-based decision-making, constant
      supply of electricity, training, widespread adoption of common data standards and
      public pressure to adopt mobile technology frameworks were identified as
      potential facilitators of HIE.Conclusion: HIE can be achieved with the support of
      the federal and provincial governments coupled with financial and technical
      backing from international donor organizations. The transition to HIE is likely
      to be very dependent on improving governance capabilities and bolstering the
      informatics skill-base in Pakistan and indeed many other LMICs.

AB  - Purpose: This article outlines the objective and structure of the Center for
      Youth Research and Practice (CYRP), its contributions toward youth research and
      practices, importance of the linkages that the CYRP has cultivated between
      research and practice, the facilitation of knowledge exchange with local and
      global institutions and professionals, and its role in future endeavors.Method: A
      social impact assessment has been implemented to address the intervention and the
      outcome based on the contributions of the CYRP to youth research and
      practices.Results: From this, the work of the CYRP on youth research and
      practices is concluded to have significant social impacts at the individual,
      social, organizational, and global levels. The work has found that the quality of
      life, self-esteem, involvement in society, empowerment through social capacity
      building, organizational development, and providing an international hub are
      crucial for youth development and wellbeing.Discussion: Hitherto, the CYRP has
      published over a hundred journal articles and held nearly 200 events including
      training courses, workshops, seminars and a conference. Over 6000 participants
      have taken part in these events and more than 60 institutions have collaborated
      with the CYRP to exchange knowledge on youth research and practices. The work of 
      the CYRP as a whole has facilitated the participation of different individuals
      and organizations. In essence, the work of the CYRP has provided important
      grounds to initiate its role as an international hub as the CYRP is now
      considered as a center of significance in youth research and practices for
      Chinese societies in the East Asia region.

AB  - Health Information Exchange (HIE) exhibits remarkable benefits for patient care
      such as improving healthcare quality and expediting coordinated care. The Office 
      of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology is seeking
      patient-centric HIE designs that shift data ownership from providers to patients.
      There are multiple barriers to patient-centric HIE in the current system, such as
      security and privacy concerns, data inconsistency, timely access to the right
      records across multiple healthcare facilities. After investigating the current
      workflow of HIE, this paper provides a feasible solution to these challenges by
      utilizing the unique features of blockchain, a distributed ledger technology
      which is considered "unhackable". Utilizing the smart contract feature, which is 
      a programmable self-executing protocol running on a blockchain, we developed a
      blockchain model to protect data security and patients' privacy, ensure data
      provenance, and provide patients full control of their health records. By
      personalizing data segmentation and an "allowed list" for clinicians to access
      their data, this design achieves patient-centric HIE. We conducted a large-scale 
      simulation of this patient-centric HIE process and quantitatively evaluated the
      model's feasibility, stability, security, and robustness.

AB  - AIM: Twitter is the most commonly used social media forum in public health and is
      considered the radio of the internet. Many health providers utilize this media to
      disseminate health information. Patient use of social media for mental health
      topics encourages providers to disseminate quality information and to develop
      virtual collaborative learning environments. This study explored trends in health
      information exchanged by patients, doctors and health organizations about
      schizophrenia through analyses of tweets posted using the #schizophrenia.
      METHODS: The likelihood that the information distributed by each user type was
      scholarly was assessed via qualitative and logistic regression analyses.
      Specifically, a sequential exploratory multimethod of data analysis guided this
      study with a sample of 981 tweets. RESULTS: Most tweets focused on the
      improvement of schizophrenia literacy (n = 366) followed by personal
      experiences/motivational stories (n = 207) and biological explanations of the
      disorder (n = 158). Logistic regression results indicated that compared to
      doctors, patients were less likely to tweet with a scholarly source (OR = 0.481, 
      CI = 0.311, .744; P < .001). All users were less likely to include a scholarly
      source when tweeting about schizophrenia literacy, personal/motivational
      experiences, campaign/organizational events or illness management in comparison
      to those who tweeted about biological explanations of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: 
      Results suggest all users disseminated beneficial information that can increase
      public schizophrenia literacy and illness management, while connecting
      individuals to organizational events targeting this debilitating disorder. Health
      providers are encouraged to establish a presence on social media to share
      scholarly work with patients and promote prompt treatment for schizophrenia.

TI  - Electronic Health Information Exchange At Discharge From Inpatient Psychiatric
      Care In Acute Care Hospitals.
PG  - 958-967
LID - 10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00985 [doi]
AB  - To address the complex health care needs of patients with mental illness-who
      commonly have co-occurring medical conditions and substance use disorders-it is
      critically important for providers to use electronic health records (EHRs) for
      health information exchange (HIE) when patients are transferred from inpatient
      psychiatric units in acute care hospitals. Efficient and timely HIE is necessary 
      to ensure that patients receive adequate and informed follow-up care. This study 
      examined the percentage of inpatient psychiatric units that reported using EHRs
      for HIE at transfers of care and hospital characteristics associated with that
      use. We linked national data from the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality
      Reporting Program of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the American
      Hospital Association Annual Survey, and state mental health privacy laws. In 2016
      the use of electronic HIE upon transfer from psychiatric units lagged behind the 
      corresponding overall use rates from acute care hospitals (56.3 percent versus 88
      percent), with wide variation across states. Hospital size and accountable care
      organization participation were associated with electronic HIE, but a state's
      having mental health privacy laws more stringent than the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act did not. Given these results, policy efforts
      to incentivize the use of electronic HIE in psychiatric settings should be
      strengthened.

LID - 10.1007/s10278-019-00294-0 [doi]
AB  - This white paper explores the considerations of standards-based interoperability 
      of medical images between organizations, patients, and providers. In this paper, 
      we will look at three different standards-based image exchange implementations
      that have been deployed to facilitate exchange of images between provider
      organizations. The paper will describe how each implementation uses applicable
      technology and standards; the image types that are included; and the governance
      policies that define participation, access, and trust. Limitations of the
      solution or non-standard approaches to solve challenges will also be identified. 
      Much can be learned from successes elsewhere, and those learnings will point to
      recommendations of best practices to facilitate the adoption of image exchange.

AB  - The US healthcare system is moving into a new era of value-based care, which
      focuses on delivering safer and higher quality care while reducing costs. Health 
      information exchange (HIE) has been a vital component in this process; however,
      there has been a lack of awareness and use of HIE among nurse leaders,
      clinicians, and researchers. The purpose of this article is to provide nurses and
      administrators with a brief overview of HIE and its impact on care delivery, as
      well as practical applications using specific case examples.

AB  - Drug safety, also called pharmacovigilance, represents a serious health problem
      all over the world. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions
      (DDIs) are two important issues in pharmacovigilance, and how to detect drug
      safety signals has drawn many researchers' attention and efforts. Currently,
      methods proposed for ADR and DDI detection are mainly based on traditional data
      sources such as spontaneous reporting data, electronic health records,
      pharmaceutical databases, and biomedical literature. However, these data sources 
      are either limited by under-reporting ratio, privacy issues, high cost, or long
      publication cycle. In this study, we propose a framework for drug safety signal
      detection by harnessing online health community data, a timely, informative, and 
      publicly available data source. Concretely, we used MedHelp as the data source to
      collect patient-contributed content based on which a weighted heterogeneous
      network was constructed. We extracted topological features from the network,
      quantified them with different weighting methods, and used supervised learning
      method for both ADR and DDI signal detection. In addition, after identifying DDI 
      signals, we proposed a new metric, named Interaction Ratio, to identify
      associated ADRs due to suspected interactions. The experiment results showed that
      our proposed techniques outperforms baseline methods.

TI  - Building and experimenting with an agent-based model to study the
      population-level impact of CommunityRx, a clinic-based community resource
      referral intervention.
PG  - e1009471
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009471 [doi]
AB  - CommunityRx (CRx), an information technology intervention, provides patients with
      a personalized list of healthful community resources (HealtheRx). In repeated
      clinical studies, nearly half of those who received clinical "doses" of the
      HealtheRx shared their information with others ("social doses"). Clinical trial
      design cannot fully capture the impact of information diffusion, which can act as
      a force multiplier for the intervention. Furthermore, experimentation is needed
      to understand how intervention delivery can optimize social spread under varying 
      circumstances. To study information diffusion from CRx under varying conditions, 
      we built an agent-based model (ABM). This study describes the model building
      process and illustrates how an ABM provides insight about information diffusion
      through in silico experimentation. To build the ABM, we constructed a synthetic
      population ("agents") using publicly-available data sources. Using clinical trial
      data, we developed empirically-informed processes simulating agent activities,
      resource knowledge evolution and information sharing. Using RepastHPC and chiSIM 
      software, we replicated the intervention in silico, simulated information
      diffusion processes, and generated emergent information diffusion networks. The
      CRx ABM was calibrated using empirical data to replicate the CRx intervention in 
      silico. We used the ABM to quantify information spread via social versus clinical
      dosing then conducted information diffusion experiments, comparing the social
      dosing effect of the intervention when delivered by physicians, nurses or
      clinical clerks. The synthetic population (N = 802,191) exhibited diverse
      behavioral characteristics, including activity and knowledge evolution patterns. 
      In silico delivery of the intervention was replicated with high fidelity.
      Large-scale information diffusion networks emerged among agents exchanging
      resource information. Varying the propensity for information exchange resulted in
      networks with different topological characteristics. Community resource
      information spread via social dosing was nearly 4 fold that from clinical dosing 
      alone and did not vary by delivery mode. This study, using CRx as an example,
      demonstrates the process of building and experimenting with an ABM to study
      information diffusion from, and the population-level impact of, a clinical
      information-based intervention. While the focus of the CRx ABM is to recreate the
      CRx intervention in silico, the general process of model building, and
      computational experimentation presented is generalizable to other large-scale
      ABMs of information diffusion.

TI  - The impact of transitioning from availability of outside records within
      electronic health records to integration of local and outside records within
      electronic health records.
PG  - 606-612
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While there has been a substantial increase in health information
      exchange, levels of outside records use by frontline providers are low. We
      assessed whether integration between outside data and local data results in
      increased viewing of outside records, overall and by encounter, provider, and
      patient type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from UCSF Health, we measured
      change in outside record views after integrating the list of local (UCSF) and
      outside (other health systems on Epic [Epic Systems, Verona, WI]) encounters on
      the Chart Review tab. Previously, providers only viewed records from outside
      encounters on a separate tab. We used an interrupted time series design (with
      outside record viewing event counts aggregated to the week level) to measure
      changes in the level and trend over a 1-year period. RESULTS: There was a large
      increase in the level of outside record views of 22 920 per week (P < .001). The 
      change in trend went from a weekly increase of 116 (P < .05) to a decrease of 402
      (P = .08), reflecting a small effect decay. There were increases in the level of 
      views for all provider and encounter types: attendings (n = 3675), residents (n =
      3277), and nurses (n = 914); and inpatient (n = 1676), emergency (n = 487), and
      outpatient (n = 7228) (P < .001 for all). Results persisted when adjusted for
      total encounter volume. DISCUSSION: While outside records were readily available 
      before the encounter integration, the simple step of clicking on a separate tab
      appears to have depressed use. CONCLUSIONS: User interface designs that comingle 
      local and outside data result in higher levels of viewing and should be more
      broadly pursued.

TI  - Provider Access to Legacy Electronic Anesthesia Records Following Implementation 
      of an Electronic Health Record System.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1232-6 [doi]
AB  - Many hospitals are in the process of replacing their legacy anesthesia
      information management system (AIMS) with an Electronic Health Record (EHR)
      system, within which the AIMS is integrated. Using the legacy AIMS security
      access log table, we studied the extent to which anesthesia providers were
      accessing historical anesthesia records (January 2006 - March 2017) following
      implementation of an EHR (April 2017). Statistical analysis was by segmented
      regression. At the time of implementation of the EHR, in 44.8% (SE = 0.3%) of
      cases, there was a prior anesthetic record for the patient that had been
      documented in the legacy AIMS. Following EHR implementation, the mean number of
      preoperative clinical views of all prior anesthetic records divided by the total 
      number of cases performed decreased to 2.3% (0.3%) from the baseline of 25.1%
      (0.8%). The estimated ratio of the 2 means was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31, P <
      0.00001). For views of unique records, the decrease was to 2.2% (0.3%) from the
      baseline of 18.3% (0.5%). The estimated ratio was 0.23 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.35, P < 
      0.00001). These results show that, following conversion to an integrated EHR,
      providing access to historical anesthesia records by maintaining the legacy AIMS 
      is not an effective strategy to promote review of such records as part of the
      preoperative evaluation process. Because such records provide important
      information for many patients, providing linked access to such records within the
      EHR as part of the patient encounter may be a more effective approach.

TI  - How Consultant Pharmacists Gained Access to Maryland's Health Information
      Exchange.
PG  - 547-552
LID - 10.4140/TCP.n.2018.547. [doi]
AB  - The Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) is a health
      information exchange in Maryland that is designed to improve communication among 
      members of the health care team including physicians, nurses, and other health
      professionals. Senior care pharmacists gained access to CRISP through successful 
      collaborative efforts at both the state and national levels. This involved
      efforts to address medication-related problems that continue to be a concern
      during transitions of care, especially for older, vulnerable adults. Having
      access to recent clinical data assists the senior care pharmacist in providing
      medication therapy management services during transitions of care-the movement of
      a patient from one setting of care to another.This article highlights the
      importance of collaboration and advocacy between state and national leadership of
      the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP) with key stakeholders to
      negotiate and gain access to such information for senior care pharmacists working
      in the post-acute and long-term care settings in Maryland.

TI  - Responding to Unsolicited Medical Requests from Health Care Professionals on
      Pharmaceutical Industry-Owned Social Media Sites: Three Pilot Studies.
PG  - e285
LID - 10.2196/jmir.9643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of social media has risen tremendously over the past decade
      with usage rates spanning from 5% American adults in 2005 up to 69% in 2016. A
      2011 survey of 4033 clinicians found that 65% physicians use social media for
      professional purposes. To meet the changing needs and preferences of their
      customers, medical information departments within the pharmaceutical industry
      must continue to assess new digital channels such as social media and evolve
      their medical information services. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to 
      pilot the use of social media as an additional channel to respond to unsolicited 
      medical requests from health care professionals (HCP RUR) directed toward the
      pharmaceutical industry. METHODS: From November 2016 to June 2017, 3 pilots were 
      conducted during 3 professional congresses: the 2016 American College of
      Rheumatology Annual Meeting, the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology
      Annual Meeting, and the 2017 American Headache Society Annual Scientific Meeting.
      For each social media account, an identified community manager monitored the
      incoming account feed for proper triaging of posts. When an unsolicited medical
      request appeared, the community manager routed the question to the Tier One
      medical information contact center agents to respond. The following metrics were 
      collected: total number of unsolicited requests directed to medical information
      contact center agents, total number of unsolicited requests that required
      escalation to Tier Two medical information associates, total number of
      unsolicited requests that were confirmed US HCPs, total number of unsolicited
      requests received after hours, and total number of unsolicited requests that were
      redirected to a different channel. RESULTS: During the 3 pilots, 9 unsolicited
      medical requests were received with request numbers ranging from 2 to 4 requests 
      per pilot. Of these, 1 was from a confirmed US HCP that required escalation to
      the Tier Two medical information associates. A majority of requests (7 out of 9) 
      came in after the scheduled monitoring hours. There were 4 requests redirected to
      the medical information contact center phone number. The marketing accounts
      received more unsolicited medical requests than the corporate accounts (7 vs 2,
      respectively), and the 3 Twitter accounts saw more overall engagement (ie,
      medical requests and other general engagement) than the LinkedIn account.
      CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of medical questions were asked by confirmed HCPs
      using social media during the 3 pilots. New innovative medical information
      contact center channels often take time to build awareness. Continued channel
      awareness is needed to fully understand the channel's desired use. Because
      consumers currently make up a majority of social media engagement, companies
      should look into creating a combined consumer and HCP RUR strategy to provide a
      better experience for all customers.

TI  - The Effects of Public Concern for Information Privacy on the Adoption of Health
      Information Exchanges (HIEs) by Healthcare Entities.
PG  - 1202-1211
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2018.1471336 [doi]
AB  - The implementation of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) by healthcare
      organizations may not achieve the desired outcomes as consumers may request that 
      their health information remains unshared because of information privacy
      concerns. Drawing on the insights of concern for information privacy (CFIP)
      literature, this work extends the application of CFIP to the HIE domain. This
      study attempts to develop and test a model centered on the four dimensions of
      CFIP construct (collection, errors, unauthorized access, and secondary use) and
      their antecedents to predict consumers' opt-in behavioral intention toward HIE in
      the presence of the perceived health status' effects. We conducted an online
      survey in the United States using 826 samples. The results demonstrate that the
      perceived health information sensitivity and computer anxiety meaningfully
      contribute to information privacy concerns and CFIP construct significantly
      impedes consumers' opt-in decision to HIEs. Interestingly, contrary to our
      expectation, perceived poor health status considerably attenuates the negative
      effects exerted by CFIP on opt-in intention. The model proposed by this study can
      be used as a useful conceptual tool by both further studies and practitioners to 
      examine the complex nature of patients' reactions to information privacy threats 
      associated with the use of HIE technology in the healthcare industry.

TI  - Examining Patterns of Information Exchange and Social Support in a Web-Based
      Health Community: Exponential Random Graph Models.
PG  - e18062
LID - 10.2196/18062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although an increasing number of studies have attempted to understand
      how people interact with others in web-based health communities, studies focusing
      on understanding individuals' patterns of information exchange and social support
      in web-based health communities are still limited. In this paper, we discuss how 
      patients' social interactions develop into social networks based on a network
      exchange framework and empirically validate the framework in web-based health
      care community contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore various patterns
      of information exchange and social support in web-based health care communities
      and identify factors that affect such patterns. METHODS: Using social network
      analysis and text mining techniques, we empirically validated a network exchange 
      framework on a 10-year data set collected from a popular web-based health
      community. A reply network was extracted from the data set, and exponential
      random graph models were used to discover patterns of information exchange and
      social support from the network. RESULTS: Results showed that reciprocated
      information exchange was common in web-based health communities. The homophily
      effect existed in general conversations but was weakened when exchanging
      knowledge. New members in web-based health communities tended to receive more
      support. Furthermore, polarized sentiment increases the chances of receiving
      replies, and optimistic users play an important role in providing social support 
      to the entire community. CONCLUSIONS: This study complements the literature on
      network exchange theories and contributes to a better understanding of social
      exchange patterns in the web-based health care context. Practically, this study
      can help web-based patients obtain information and social support more
      effectively.

TI  - Patients' Perceptions of Different Information Exchange Mechanisms: An
      Exploratory Study in the United States.
PG  - 162-178
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1721784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients may seek health care services from various providers during 
      treatment. These providers could serve in a network (affiliated) or practice
      separately (unaffiliated). Thus, using secure and reliable health information
      exchange (HIE) mechanisms would be critical to transfer sensitive personal health
      information (PHI) across distances. Studying patients' perceptions and opinions
      about exchange mechanisms could help health care providers build more complete
      HIEs' databases and develop robust privacy policies, consent processes, and
      patient education programs. OBJECTIVES: Due to the exploratory nature of this
      study, we aim to shed more light on public perspectives (benefits, concerns, and 
      risks) associated with the four data exchange practices in the health care
      sector. METHODS: In this study, we compared public perceptions and expectations
      regarding four common types of exchange mechanisms used in the United States
      (i.e., traditional, direct, query-based, patient-mediated exchange mechanisms).
      Traditional is an exchange through fax, paper mailing, or phone calls, direct is 
      a provider-to-provider exchange, query-based is sharing patient data with a
      central repository, and patient-mediated is an exchange mechanism in which
      patients can access data and monitor sharing. Data were collected from 1,624
      subjects using an online survey to examine the benefits, risks, and concerns
      associated with the four exchange mechanisms from patients' perspectives.
      RESULTS: Findings indicate that several concerns and risks such as privacy
      concerns, security risks, trust issues, and psychological risks are raised.
      Besides, multiple benefits such as access to complete information, communication 
      improvement, timely and convenient information sharing, cost-saving, and medical 
      error reduction are highlighted by respondents. Through consideration of all
      risks and benefits associated with the four exchange mechanisms, the direct HIE
      mechanism was selected by respondents as the most preferred mechanism of
      information exchange among providers. More than half of the respondents (56.18%) 
      stated that overall they favored direct exchange over the other mechanisms.
      42.70% of respondents expected to be more likely to share their PHI with health
      care providers who implemented and utilized a direct exchange mechanism. 43.26%
      of respondents believed that they would support health care providers to leverage
      a direct HIE mechanism for sharing their PHI with other providers. The results
      exhibit that individuals expect greater benefits and fewer adverse effects from
      direct HIE among health care providers. Overall, the general public sentiment is 
      more in favor of direct data transfer. Our results highlight that greater public 
      trust in exchange mechanisms is required, and information privacy and security
      risks must be addressed before the widespread implementation of such mechanisms. 
      CONCLUSION: This exploratory study's findings could be interesting for health
      care providers and HIE policymakers to analyze how consumers perceive the current
      exchange mechanisms, what concerns should be addressed, and how the exchange
      mechanisms could be modified to meet consumers' needs.

TI  - Quality of electronic records documenting adverse drug reactions within a
      hospital setting: identification of discrepancies and information completeness.
PG  - 28-37
AB  - AIM: Incomplete and incorrect documentation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can 
      restrict prescribing choices resulting in suboptimal pharmaceutical care. This
      study aimed to examine the quality of information held within electronic systems 
      in a hospital setting, to determine the preciseness of ADR documentation, and
      identify discrepancies where multiple electronic systems are utilised. METHOD:
      Over a four-week period, consecutive patients admitted to the general medical
      ward at the study hospital had their electronic profiles reviewed. Patient
      demographic information (de-identified), ADR history and discrepancies between
      information sources (as recorded in all electronic systems utilised at initial
      prescribing) were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Over the four-week period, 332 
      patient profiles were reviewed, and over 1,200 alerts were identified and
      analysed (including duplicates of ADR reactions). Of these patients, 151 (45.5%) 
      had at least one documented allergy or intolerance which generated 585 reactions,
      relating to 526 unique events. A further 151 (45.5%) were classified as having no
      known (drug) allergies or intolerances; however, 20 (15%) of these patients did
      have at least one allergy documented in at least one other electronic system. The
      remaining 30 (9%) patients were classified as having an unknown allergy status
      and of those nine had allergies documented in at least one other electronic
      system. Further, most systems contained information duplication, which had not
      been addressed during the admission process. CONCLUSION: ADR information was both
      imprecise and inaccurate, as multiple discrepancies between ADR information
      recorded in different electronic patient management systems were found to exist. 
      Information sharing between systems needs to be prioritised in order to allow
      full, accurate and complete ADR information to be collected, stored and utilised;
      both to reduce current inadequacies and to allow optimal pharmaceutical care.

TI  - Understanding the role of health information in patients' experiences: secondary 
      analysis of qualitative narrative interviews with people diagnosed with cancer in
      Germany.
PG  - e019576
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019576 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the role and meaning of health information in individuals' 
      experiences with either breast, colorectal or prostate cancer in order to better 
      understand unmet information needs of people with a cancer diagnosis. DESIGN:
      This is a secondary analysis of data from a qualitative interview study including
      narrative interviews and maximum variation sampling. A thematic analysis was
      conducted, followed by an in-depth analysis based on the principles of grounded
      theory. SETTING: Interviewees were sought across Germany through self-help
      organisations, primary care clinics, rehabilitation facilities, physicians and
      other healthcare professionals to develop cancer modules for the website
      krankheitserfahrungen.de (illness experiences.de). PARTICIPANTS: Women with a
      diagnosis of breast cancer, individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and
      men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. RESULTS: The meaning and role of
      information in the illness experiences were clearly associated with gaining
      control in a seemingly uncontrollable situation in which others -people, the
      disease- take over. Four categories characterise the ways in which information
      helped interviewees to regain a sense of control following a diagnosis of cancer:
      'becoming confident in one's treatment decision', 'taking responsibility for
      one's situation', 'understanding the consequences of the disease and treatment
      for one's life', and 'dealing with fear'. There was, however, always a fine line 
      between information seeking and becoming overwhelmed by information. CONCLUSIONS:
      Information needs to be understood as a management tool for handling the disease 
      and its (potential) consequences. Patients' unmet needs for information might not
      be easily solved by a simple increase in the amount of information because
      emotional support and respect for patient autonomy might also play a role. The
      evaluation of one's own information behaviour and the information received is
      closely linked to how the illness unfolds. This makes it challenging to document 
      unmet information needs and satisfaction with information independent of an
      individual's illness trajectory over time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact in the adoption of electronic health records
      and health information exchanges by local health departments on population
      health. METHODS: The study analyzed 433 local health departments population-based
      data across 433 counties in the United States. Controlling for high school
      graduation rate, percentage of adults with some post- secondary education, race, 
      median household income, percentage rural, population size served, governance
      structure of local health departments and revenue, the study used multiple linear
      regression to analyze the impact in the adoption of health information technology
      by local health departments on the population health of a county. RESULTS:
      Electronic health records adoption was statistically significant at improving
      population health at the county level. Health information exchange adoption was
      not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: When local health departments adopt
      electronic health records, it improves health- related quality of life and
      reduces years of potential life lost. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The value derived from
      the adoption of electronic health records by local health departments deserves
      attention because of its abilities to enhance the services provided at local
      health departments. It is important for local health departments to use health
      information technology to electronically capture patient information to improve
      upon the services received at community health centers.

TI  - Technology, Incentives, or Both? Factors Related to Level of Hospital Health
      Information Exchange.
PG  - 3285-3308
LID - 10.1111/1475-6773.12838 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the level of health information exchange (HIE) in
      U.S. hospitals is related to technology capabilities, incentives to exchange, or 
      both. STUDY SETTING: A total of 1,812 hospitals attesting to stage 2 of
      Medicare's Meaningful Use Incentive Program through April 2016. STUDY DESIGN:
      Hospital-level, multivariate OLS regression with state fixed effects was used to 
      analyze the relationship between technology capability and incentives measures,
      and percent of care transitions with summary of care records (SCRs) sent
      electronically to subsequent providers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stage 2 hospitals
      reported sending SCRs electronically for an average of 41 percent (median = 33
      percent) of transitions. HIE level is related to four capability measures, one
      incentive measure, and one measure that is related to both capability and
      incentive. Percent of transitions with SCRs sent electronically was 3 percentage 
      points higher (95 percent CI: 0.1-5.1) for hospitals with a third-party HIE
      vendor, 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 0.5-5.4) for hospitals with an
      EHR vendor as their HIE vendor, and 3 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      0.4-5.4) for hospitals that automatically alert primary care providers. The
      direction and statistical significance of the relationships between specific EHR 
      vendor and electronic SCR transmission level varied by vendor. Nonprofits and
      government hospitals performed 5 percentage points higher (95 percent CI:
      1.5-9.1) and 8 percentage points higher (95 percent CI: 3.4-12.3) than
      for-profits. Hospitals in systems performed 3 percentage points higher (95
      percent CI: 0.8-6.1). CONCLUSION: The overall level of HIE is low, with hospitals
      sending an SCR electronically for less than half of patient transitions. Specific
      hospital characteristics related to both technology capabilities and incentives
      were associated with higher levels of HIE.

TI  - Generalizable Layered Blockchain Architecture for Health Care Applications:
      Development, Case Studies, and Evaluation.
PG  - e19029
LID - 10.2196/19029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data coordination across multiple health care facilities has become
      increasingly important for many emerging health care applications. Distrust has
      been recognized as a key barrier to the success of such applications. Leveraging 
      blockchain technology could provide potential solutions tobuild trust between
      data providers and receivers by taking advantage of blockchain properties such as
      security, immutability, anonymity, decentralization, and smart contracts. Many
      health technologies have empirically proven that blockchain designs fit well with
      the needs of health care applications with certain degrees of success. However,
      there is a lack of robust architecture to provide a practical framework for
      developers to implement applications and test the performance of stability,
      efficiency, and scalability using standard blockchain designs. A generalized
      blockchain model is needed for the health care community to adopt blockchain
      technology and develop applications in a timely fashion. OBJECTIVE: This study
      aimed at building a generalized blockchain architecture that provides data
      coordination functions, including data requests, permission granting, data
      exchange, and usage tracking, for a wide spectrum of health care application
      developments. METHODS: An augmented, 3-layered blockchain architecture was built 
      on a private blockchain network. The 3 layers, from bottom to top, are as
      follows: (1) incorporation of fundamental blockchain settings and smart contract 
      design for data collection; (2) interactions between the blockchain and health
      care application development environment using Node.js and web3.js; and (3) a
      flexible development platform that supports web technologies such as HTML, https,
      and various programing languages. Two example applications, health information
      exchange (HIE) and clinical trial recruitment, were developed in our design to
      demonstrate the feasibility of the layered architecture. Case studies were
      conducted to test the performance in terms of stability, efficiency, and
      scalability of the blockchain system. RESULTS: A total of 331,142 simulated HIE
      requests from accounts of 40,000 patients were successfully validated through
      this layered blockchain architecture with an average exchange time of 11.271 (SD 
      2.208) seconds. We also simulated a clinical trial recruitment scenario with the 
      same set of patients and various recruitment criteria to match potential subjects
      using the same architecture. Potential subjects successfully received the
      clinical trial recruitment information and granted permission to the trial
      sponsors to access their health records with an average time of 3.07 seconds.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a generalized layered blockchain architecture
      that offers health technology community blockchain features for application
      development without requiring developers to have extensive experience with
      blockchain technology. The case studies tested the performance of our design and 
      empirically proved the feasibility of the architecture in 2 relevant health
      application domains.

TI  - Gaps in health information exchange between hospitals that treat many shared
      patients.
PG  - 1114-1121
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy089 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hospitals that routinely share patients are those that most critically
      need to engage in electronic health information exchange (HIE) with each other to
      ensure clinical information is available to inform treatment decisions. We
      surveyed pairs of hospitals in a nationwide sample to describe whether and how
      hospitals within each hospital referral region (HRR) that have the highest shared
      patient (HSP) volume engaged in HIE with each other. Methods: We used Medicare's 
      Physician Shared Patient Patterns data to identify hospital pairs with the
      highest shared patient volume in each hospital referral region. We surveyed a
      purposeful sample of pairs and then calculated descriptive statistics to compare:
      (1) HIE with the HSP hospital vs HIE with other hospitals, and (2) HIE with the
      HSP hospital versus federal measures of HIE engagement that are not
      partner-specific. Results: We received responses from 25.5% of contacted
      hospitals and 33.5% of contacted pairs, allowing us to examine information
      sharing among 68 hospitals in 63 pairs. 23% of respondents reported worse
      information sharing with their HSP hospital than with other hospitals while 17%
      indicated better sharing with their HSP hospital and 48% indicated no difference.
      Our HSP-specific measures of HIE differed from federal measures of HIE
      engagement: while 97% of respondents are classified as routinely sending
      information electronically in federal measures, in our data only 63% did so with 
      their HSP hospital. Conclusions: Despite increased HIE engagement, our
      descriptive results indicate that HIE is not developing in a way that facilitates
      information exchange where it might benefit the most patients. New policy
      efforts, particularly those emerging from the 21st Century Cures Act, need to
      explicitly pursue strategies that ensure that HSP providers engage in exchange
      with each other.

TI  - Alternative payment models and hospital engagement in health information
      exchange.
PG  - e1-e6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether hospital participation in alternative payment
      models (APMs) is associated with greater engagement in health information
      exchange (HIE) along 4 dimensions: volume of patients for whom information is
      exchanged, diversity of information types, breadth of partner types, and depth of
      technical approach. STUDY DESIGN: Pooled, cross-sectional analysis of data on US 
      hospitals from 2014 to 2015. METHODS: APM participation came from Leavitt
      Partners data, Medicare public use files, and the American Hospital Association
      (AHA) Annual Survey. We used Medicare data to measure HIE volume for 798
      hospitals attesting to stage 2 Meaningful Use and the AHA Information Technology 
      Supplement to measure HIE diversity, breadth, and depth for 1730 hospitals. We
      used mixed-effects regression to estimate the association between participation
      in APMs and each dimension of HIE. RESULTS: Compared with nonparticipating
      hospitals, full-year APM participation was associated with lower HIE volume (data
      were sent for 11 percentage points fewer discharges; P = .003), greater HIE
      diversity (of 4 data types, 0.3 more were transmitted; P <.001), greater HIE
      breadth (of 3 partner types, data were sent to 0.3 more; P <.001), and greater
      HIE depth (the odds of using a push and pull approach were 1.68 times greater; P 
      = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that APM participation was associated with
      greater HIE diversity, breadth, and depth suggests that value-based payment may
      be spurring improvements in HIE infrastructure. However, our finding that APM
      participation is associated with lower HIE volume suggests that there may be an
      incentive to focus HIE investments on a limited number of partners.

TI  - The relationship between hospital and ehr vendor market dynamics on health
      information organization presence and participation.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0605-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health Information Organizations (HIOs) are third party organizations
      that facilitate electronic health information exchange (HIE) between providers in
      a geographic area. Despite benefits from HIE, HIOs have struggled to form and
      subsequently gain broad provider participation. We sought to assess whether
      market-level hospital and EHR vendor dynamics are associated with presence and
      level of hospital participation in HIOs. METHODS: 2014 data on 4523 hospitals and
      their EHR vendors were aggregated to the market level. We used multivariate OLS
      regression to analyze the relationship between hospital and vendor dynamics and
      (1) probability of HIO presence and (2) percent of hospitals participating in an 
      HIO. RESULTS: 298 of 469 markets (64%) had HIO presence, and in those markets,
      47% of hospitals participated in an HIO on average. In multivariate analysis,
      four characteristics were associated with HIO presence. Markets with more
      hospitals, markets with more EHR vendors, and markets with an EHR vendor-led HIE 
      approach were more likely to have an HIO. Compared to markets with low hospital
      competition, markets with high hospital competition had a 25 percentage point
      lower probability of HIO presence. Two characteristics were associated with level
      of hospital HIO participation. Markets with more hospitals as well as markets
      with high vendor competition (compared to low competition) had lower
      participation. CONCLUSION: Both hospital and EHR vendor dynamics are associated
      with whether a market has an HIO as well as the level of hospital participation
      in HIOs.

      healthcare. However, exchanging health information brings the risk of privacy
      issues. To better manage privacy risks we first need to understand the different 
      patterns of patient-centred care in order to tailor solutions to address privacy 
      risks. METHODS: Drawing upon published literature, we develop a business model to
      enable patient-centred care via telehealth. The model identifies three
      patient-centred connected health patterns. We then use the patterns to analyse
      potential privacy risks and possible solutions from different types of telehealth
      delivery. RESULTS: Connected healthcare raises the risk of unwarranted access to 
      health data and related invasion of privacy. However, the risk and extent of
      privacy issues differ according to the pattern of patient-centred care delivery
      and the type of particular challenge as they enable the highest degree of
      connectivity and thus the greatest potential for privacy breaches. CONCLUSION:
      Privacy issues are a major concern in telehealth systems and patients, providers,
      and administrators need to be aware of these privacy issues and have guidance on 
      how to manage them. This paper integrates patient-centred connected health care, 
      telehealth, and privacy risks to provide an understanding of how risks vary
      across different patterns of patient-centred connected health and different types
      of telehealth delivery.

AB  - Medical interventions are becoming more complex day by day. Moreover, compared
      with the past, more healthcare professionals take part in the same intervention
      in the field of medicine. The use of technology in medical interventions has also
      increased. This change in the health sector brings together several legal
      discussions. In this study, the legal consequences that arise from the treatment 
      processes carried out by the residents and resident educators (registerers /
      attending physicians), the exchange of information between them, and the usage of
      some messaging platforms, especially WhatsApp, in this process will be analyzed.

      centres of excellence in public health.
PG  - i31-i38
LID - 10.1093/pubmed/fdx150 [doi]
AB  - Background: In 2008, five UKCRC Public Health Research Centres of Excellence were
      created to develop a coordinated approach to policy and practice engagement and
      knowledge exchange. The five Centres have developed their own models and
      practices for achieving these aims, which have not been compared in detail to
      date. Methods: We applied an extended version of Saner's model for the interface 
      between science and policy to compare five case studies of knowledge exchanges,
      one from each centre. We compared these practices on three dimensions within our 
      model (focus, function and type/scale) to identify barriers and facilitators for 
      knowledge exchange. Results: The case studies shared commonalities in their range
      of activities (type) but illustrated different ways of linking these activities
      (function). The Centres' approaches ranged from structural to more organic, and
      varied in the extent that they engaged internal audiences (focus). Each centre
      addressed policymakers at different geographical levels and scale. Conclusions:
      This article emphasizes the importance of linking a range of activities that
      engage policymakers at different levels, intensities and points in their
      decision-making processes to build relationships. Developing a structural
      approach to knowledge exchange activities in different contexts presents
      challenges of resource, implementation and evaluation.

TI  - Hospital adoption of multiple health information exchange approaches and
      information accessibility.
PG  - 577-583
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hospital engagement in electronic health information exchange (HIE)
      has increased over recent years. We aimed to 1) determine the change in adoption 
      of 3 types of information exchange: secure messaging, provider portals, and use
      of an HIE; and 2) to assess if growth in each approach corresponded to increased 
      ability to access and integrate patient information from outside providers.
      METHODS: Panel analysis of all nonfederal, acute care hospitals in the United
      States using hospital- and year-fixed effects. The sample consisted of 1917
      hospitals that responded to the American Hospital Association Information
      Technology Supplement every year from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS: Adoption of each
      approach increased by 9-15 percentage points over the study period. The average
      number of HIE approaches used by each hospital increased from 1.0 to 1.4.
      Adoption of each approach was associated with increased likelihood that providers
      routinely had necessary outside information of 4.2-12.7 percentage points and
      4.5-13.3 percentage points increase in information integration. Secure messaging 
      was associated with the largest increase in both. Adoption of 1 approach
      increased the likelihood of having outside information by 10.3 percentage points,
      while adopting a second approach further increased the likelihood by 9.5
      percentage points. Trends in number of approaches and integration were similar.
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: No single HIE tool provided high levels of usable,
      integrated health information. Instead, hospitals benefited from adopting
      multiple tools. Policy initiatives that reduce the complexity of enabling high
      value HIE could result in broader adoption of HIE and use of information to
      inform care.

TI  - Development and evaluation of an electronic hospital referral system: a human
      factors approach.
PG  - 710-723
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2020.1748232 [doi]
AB  - Coordinating care across hospitals has been identified as a patient safety risk
      as referrals are often paper-based and poorly documented. Electronic referral
      systems have the potential to improve the situation but can fail to gain uptake. 
      We applied a human factors/ergonomics (HFE) approach to place analysis of local
      workflow and user engagement central to the development of a new regional
      electronic referral system. The intervention was evaluated with a
      before-and-after study. Referral quality improved, referrals containing
      sufficient clinical information for continuation of care increased from 36.9% to 
      83.5% and completeness of referral information significantly improved. There was 
      a 35.7% reduction in the number of calls to the on-call specialist, and the mean 
      period between admission and surgery for expedited transfers was reduced.
      Applying HFE informed design with use-based evidence; the system maintains
      sustained uptake three years after implementation. Reliable recording of
      information translates to better patient safety during inter-hospital
      transitions. Practitioners summary: This study developed, implemented and
      evaluated a clinical referral system using a human factors approach. Process
      analysis and usability studies were used to inform the application requirements
      and design. Region-wide implementation in hospitals resulted in the improved
      quality and completeness of clinical referral information and efficiencies in the
      referral process.

TI  - Development of a gateway for interoperability in community-based care: An
      empirical study.
PG  - 57-67
LID - 10.3233/THC-170841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information and communications technology has attracted attention as 
      a useful way of sharing care records in community-based care. Such information
      sharing systems, however, imposed the burden of inputting the same records into
      different information systems due to a lack of interoperability of the systems.
      OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a gateway that links
      information systems and to investigate the functionality and usability of the
      gateway through an empirical study. METHODS: We developed a gateway with
      healthcare and welfare professionals in Kashiwa city, Japan. The gateway system
      consisted of two sub-systems: a data exchange sub-system and a common sub-system.
      Regarding the security, we used the transport layer security 1.2 and a public key
      infrastructure. For document formats, we utilized the health level seven
      international, extensible markup language, and portable document format. In
      addition, we performed an empirical study with 11 scenarios of four simulated
      patients and a questionnaire survey to the professionals. RESULTS: Professionals 
      of eight occupations participated the empirical study and verified the gateway to
      link information systems of six vendors. For a questionnaire survey, 32
      professionals out of 40 reported that the gateway would eliminate the burden of
      inputting the same records into different information systems.
